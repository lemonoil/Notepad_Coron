Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that broughtcountless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it sendhurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogsand vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from theday on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, firstfell out with one another.

　　And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was theson of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent apestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son ofAtreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to theships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him agreat ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollowreathed with a suppliant's wreath and he besought the Achaeans, butmost of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.

　　"Sons of Atreus," he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the godswho dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reachyour homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom forher, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove."

　　On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were forrespecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but notso Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away."Old man," said he, "let me not find you tarrying about our ships, noryet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shallprofit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in myhouse at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loomand visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be theworse for you."

　　The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but wentby the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollowhom lovely Leto had borne. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of thesilver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedoswith thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked yourtemple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls orgoats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears uponthe Danaans."

　　Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came downfurious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiverupon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the ragethat trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships witha face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shothis arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and theirhounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves,and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning.

　　For nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but uponthe tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion uponthem. Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.

　　"Son of Atreus," said he, "I deem that we should now turn rovinghome if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down bywar and pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or somereader of dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us whyPhoebus Apollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that wehave broken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he willaccept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to takeaway the plague from us."

　　With these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisestof augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. Heit was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius,through the prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him.With all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:-

　　"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger ofKing Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear thatyou will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that Ishall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all theAchaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the angerof a king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurserevenge till he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no youwill protect me."

　　And Achilles answered, "Fear not, but speak as it is borne in uponyou from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whoseoracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his handupon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth- no, notthough you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of theAchaeans."

　　Thereon the seer spoke boldly. "The god," he said, "is angry neitherabout vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest's sake, whom Agamemnonhas dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take aransom for her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and willyet send others. He will not deliver the Danaans from thispestilence till Agamemnon has restored the girl without fee orransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse. Thuswe may perhaps appease him."

　　With these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heartwas black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled onCalchas and said, "Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooththings concerning me, but have ever loved to foretell that which wasevil. You have brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now youcome seeing among Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued usbecause I would not take a ransom for this girl, the daughter ofChryses. I have set my heart on keeping her in my own house, for Ilove her better even than my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer sheis alike in form and feature, in understanding and accomplishments.Still I will give her up if I must, for I would have the peoplelive, not die; but you must find me a prize instead, or I aloneamong the Argives shall be without one. This is not well; for youbehold, all of you, that my prize is to go elsewhither."

　　And Achilles answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyondall mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have nocommon store from which to take one. Those we took from the citieshave been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been madealready. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jovegrants us to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three andfourfold."

　　Then Agamemnon said, "Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall notthus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me.Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss andgive up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prizein fair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, orthat of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shallrue my coming. But of this we will take thought hereafter; for thepresent, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for herexpressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseisalso; further, let some chief man among us be in command, either Ajax,or Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are,that we may offer sacrifice and appease the the anger of the god."

　　Achilles scowled at him and answered, "You are steeped ininsolence and lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans doyour bidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I came notwarring here for any ill the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrelwith them. They have not raided my cattle nor my horses, nor cutdown my harvests on the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and themthere is a great space, both mountain and sounding sea. We havefollowed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not ours- to gainsatisfaction from the Trojans for your shameless self and forMenelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize forwhich I have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me.Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of the Trojans do I receiveso good a prize as you do, though it is my hands that do the betterpart of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far thelargest, and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I canget and be thankful, when my labour of fighting is done. Now,therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much better for me toreturn home with my ships, for I will not stay here dishonoured togather gold and substance for you."

　　And Agamemnon answered, "Fly if you will, I shall make you noprayers to stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, andabove all Jove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here sohateful to me as you are, for you are ever quarrelsome and illaffected. What though you be brave? Was it not heaven that made youso? Go home, then, with your ships and comrades to lord it over theMyrmidons. I care neither for you nor for your anger; and thus willI do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Chryseis from me, I shall sendher with my ship and my followers, but I shall come to your tent andtake your own prize Briseis, that you may learn how much stronger I amthan you are, and that another may fear to set himself up as equalor comparable with me."

　　The son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggybreast was divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside,and kill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check hisanger. While he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mightysword from its scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno hadsent her in the love she bore to them both), and seized the son ofPeleus by his yellow hair, visible to him alone, for of the othersno man could see her. Achilles turned in amaze, and by the fire thatflashed from her eyes at once knew that she was Minerva. "Why areyou here," said he, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove? To see thepride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shallsurely be- he shall pay for this insolence with his life."

　　And Minerva said, "I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bidyou stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of youalike. Cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail athim if you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you-and it shall surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts threetimes as splendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore,and obey."

　　"Goddess," answered Achilles, "however angry a man may be, he mustdo as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hearthe prayers of him who has obeyed them."

　　He stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust itback into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back toOlympus among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.

　　But the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus,for he was still in a rage. "Wine-bibber," he cried, "with the face ofa dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with thehost in fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun thisas you do death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizesfrom any man who contradicts you. You devour your people, for youare king over a feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforwardyou would insult no man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a greatoath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf norshoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left its parent stem uponthe mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and bark, and now thesons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians of the decrees ofheaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter they shalllook fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the day of yourdistress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of Hector,you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your heart withrage for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest of theAchaeans."

　　With this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on theground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginningfiercely from his place upon the other side. Then uprosesmooth-tongued Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, and thewords fell from his lips sweeter than honey. Two generations of menborn and bred in Pylos had passed away under his rule, and he wasnow reigning over the third. With all sincerity and goodwill,therefore, he addressed them thus:-

　　"Of a truth," he said, "a great sorrow has befallen the Achaeanland. Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans beglad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who areso excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you;therefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend ofmen even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.Never again can I behold such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd ofhis people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseusson of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest menever born upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they foughtthe fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. Icame from distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they wouldhave me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now livingcould withstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded bythem. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellentway. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girlaway, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles;and you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who bythe grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon. Youare strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon isstronger than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus,check your anger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, whoin the day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans."

　　And Agamemnon answered, "Sir, all that you have said is true, butthis fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lordof all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be.Granted that the gods have made him a great warrior, have they alsogiven him the right to speak with railing?"

　　Achilles interrupted him. "I should be a mean coward," he cried,"were I to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, notme, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my sayingto your heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about thisgirl, for those that take were those also that gave. But of all elsethat is at my ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, thatothers may see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with yourblood."

　　When they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up theassembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went backto his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company,while Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew oftwenty oarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover ahecatomb for the god. And Ulysses went as captain.

　　These, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. Butthe son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so theypurified themselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then theyoffered hecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore,and the smoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose curling uptowards heaven.

　　Thus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon didnot forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trustymessengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. "Go," said he, "tothe tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand andbring her hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others andtake her- which will press him harder."

　　He charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereonthey went their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came tothe tents and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting byhis tent and his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them.They stood fearfully and reverently before him, and never a word didthey speak, but he knew them and said, "Welcome, heralds, messengersof gods and men; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but withAgamemnon who has sent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus,bring her and give her to them, but let them be witnesses by theblessed gods, by mortal men, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon'sanger, that if ever again there be need of me to save the peoplefrom ruin, they shall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is madwith rage and knows not how to look before and after that the Achaeansmay fight by their ships in safety."

　　Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseisfrom the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with themto the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. ThenAchilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping andlooking out upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands inprayer to his immortal mother, "Mother," he cried, "you bore me doomedto live but for a little season; surely Jove, who thunders fromOlympus, might have made that little glorious. It is not so.Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed meof my prize by force."

　　As he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she wassitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father.Forthwith she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat downbefore him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, andsaid, "My son, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you?Keep it not from me, but tell me, that we may know it together."

　　Achilles drew a deep sigh and said, "You know it; why tell youwhat you know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city ofEetion, sacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of theAchaeans shared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis asthe meed of Agamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to theships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him agreat ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo,wreathed with a suppliant's wreath, and he besought the Achaeans,but most of all the two sons of Atreus who were their chiefs.

　　"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respectingthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not soAgamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. Sohe went back in anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard hisprayer. Then the god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and thepeople died thick on one another, for the arrows went everywhitheramong the wide host of the Achaeans. At last a seer in the fulnessof his knowledge declared to us the oracles of Apollo, and I wasmyself first to say that we should appease him. Whereon the son ofAtreus rose in anger, and threatened that which he has since done. TheAchaeans are now taking the girl in a ship to Chryse, and sendinggifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken from mytent the daughter of Briseus, whom the Achaeans had awarded to myself.

　　"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, andif you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aidof Jove. Ofttimes in my father's house have I heard you glory inthat you alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin,when the others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have puthim in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling toOlympus the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but menAegaeon, for he is stronger even than his father; when therefore hetook his seat all-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other godswere afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of allthis, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans. Letthe Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perishon the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of theirking, and that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult tothe foremost of the Achaeans."

　　Thetis wept and answered, "My son, woe is me that I should haveborne or suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span freefrom all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that youshould be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers:woe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless Iwill go to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove,if he will hear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with yourships, nurse your anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof fromfight. For Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast among theEthiopians, and the other gods went with him. He will return toOlympus twelve days hence; I will then go to his mansion paved withbronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able topersuade him."

　　On this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had beentaken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.When they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laidthem in the ship's hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered themast into its place, and rowed the ship to the place where theywould have her lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones andmade fast the hawsers. They then got out upon the sea-shore and landedthe hecatomb for Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulyssesled her to the altar to deliver her into the hands of her father."Chryses," said he, "King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back yourchild, and to offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, thatwe may propitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow upon theArgives."

　　So saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received hergladly, and they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round thealtar of the god. They washed their hands and took up thebarley-meal to sprinkle over the victims, while Chryses lifted uphis hands and prayed aloud on their behalf. "Hear me," he cried, "Ogod of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla, andrulest Tenedos with thy might. Even as thou didst hear me aforetimewhen I prayed, and didst press hardly upon the Achaeans, so hear meyet again, and stay this fearful pestilence from the Danaans."

　　Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had donepraying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads ofthe victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out thethigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set somepieces of raw meat on the top of them, and then Chryses laid them onthe wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men stoodnear him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When thethigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cutthe rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted them tillthey were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finishedtheir work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had hisfull share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enoughto eat and drink, pages filled the mixing-bowl with wine and water andhanded it round, after giving every man his drink-offering.

　　Thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song,hymning him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god tookpleasure in their voices; but when the sun went down, and it came ondark, they laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of theship, and when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared theyagain set sail for the host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fairwind, so they raised their mast and hoisted their white sails aloft.As the sail bellied with the wind the ship flew through the deepblue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.When they reached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, theydrew the vessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strongprops beneath her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships.

　　But Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not tothe honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed athis own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.

　　Now after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body toOlympus, and Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of thecharge her son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea andwent through great heaven with early morning to Olympus, where shefound the mighty son of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmostridges. She sat herself down before him, and with her left hand seizedhis knees, while with her right she caught him under the chin, andbesought him, saying-

　　"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among theimmortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is tobe cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by takinghis prize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lordof counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans givemy son his due and load him with riches in requital."

　　Jove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis stillkept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time."Incline your head," said she, "and promise me surely, or else denyme- for you have nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly youdisdain me."

　　At this Jove was much troubled and answered, "I shall have troubleif you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me withher taunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before theother gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go backnow, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and willbring it about as wish. See, I incline my head that you believe me.This is the most solemn that I can give to any god. I never recallmy word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded myhead."

　　As he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and theambrosial locks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus reeled.

　　When the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to hishouse, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plungedinto the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before thecoming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but allstood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. ButJuno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman's daughter,silver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once beganto upbraid him. "Trickster," she cried, "which of the gods have youbeen taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters insecret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could helpit, one word of your intentions."

　　"Juno," replied the sire of gods and men, "you must not expect to beinformed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find ithard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there isno one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep amatter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions."

　　"Dread son of Saturn," answered Juno, "what are you talking about?I? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way ineverything. Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman'sdaughter Thetis has been talking you over, for she was with you andhad hold of your knees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore,that you have been promising her to give glory to Achilles, and tokill much people at the ships of the Achaeans."

　　"Wife," said Jove, "I can do nothing but you suspect me and findit out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike youthe more, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as yousay; I mean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bidyou for if I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all heavenwere on your side it would profit you nothing."

　　On this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and satdown in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughoutthe house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try andpacify his mother Juno. "It will be intolerable," said he, "if you twofall to wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack ofmortals. If such ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have nopleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my mother- and she mustherself know that it will be better- to make friends with my dearfather Jove, lest he again scold her and disturb our feast. If theOlympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from our seats, he can doso, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair words, and he willthen soon be in a good humour with us."

　　As he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in hismother's hand. "Cheer up, my dear mother," said he, "and make the bestof it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get athrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help for there isno standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you,he caught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly threshold. Allday long from morn till eve, was I falling, till at sunset I came toground in the island of Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little lifeleft in me, till the Sintians came and tended me."

　　Juno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from herson's hands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, andserved it round among the gods, going from left to right; and theblessed gods laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ingbustling about the heavenly mansion.

　　Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun theyfeasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied.Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices,calling and answering one another. But when the sun's glorious lighthad faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lameVulcan with his consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove,the Olympian Lord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he alwaysslept; and when he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of thegolden throne by his side.

　　BOOK II

　　Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain sleptsoundly, but Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour toAchilles, and destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. Inthe end he deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to KingAgamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it, "Lying Dream, go tothe ships of the Achaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say tohim word to word as I now bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeansinstantly under arms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longerdivided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them to her ownmind, and woe betides the Trojans."

　　The dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached theships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found himin his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his headin the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honouredabove all his councillors, and said:-

　　"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of hishost and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock hissleep. Hear me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who,though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. Hebids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall takeTroy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno hasbrought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans atthe hands of Jove. Remember this, and when you wake see that it doesnot escape you."

　　The dream then left him, and he thought of things that were,surely not to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he wasto take the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mindof Jove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store alike forDanaans and Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the divine messagestill ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his softshirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound hissandals on to his comely feet, and slung his silver-studded swordabout his shoulders; then he took the imperishable staff of hisfather, and sallied forth to the ships of the Achaeans.

　　The goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she mightherald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sentthe criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called themand the people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting ofthe elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they wereassembled he laid a cunning counsel before them.

　　"My friends," said he, "I have had a dream from heaven in the deadof night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor's. Ithovered over my head and said, 'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; onewho has the welfare of his host and so much other care upon hisshoulders should dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messengerfrom Jove, who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you andpities you. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for youshall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among thegods; Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betidesthe Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this.' The dream thenvanished and I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of theAchaeans. But it will be well that I should first sound them, and tothis end I will tell them to fly with their ships; but do you othersgo about among the host and prevent their doing so."

　　He then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with allsincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: "My friends," said he,"princes and councillors of the Argives, if any other man of theAchaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it false,and would have had nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it isthe foremost man among us; we must therefore set about getting thepeople under arms."

　　With this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptredkings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but thepeople pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally fromsome hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the springflowers, bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mightymultitude pour from ships and tents to the assembly, and rangethemselves upon the wide-watered shore, while among them ranWildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thusthey gathered in a pell-mell of mad confusion, and the earth groanedunder the tramp of men as the people sought their places. Nine heraldswent crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid themlisten to the kings, till at last they were got into their severalplaces and ceased their clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding hissceptre. This was the work of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son ofSaturn. Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide andguardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, andPelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when he died, leftit to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to beborne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of all Argos and of theisles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed the Argives.

　　"My friends," he said, "heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heavenhas been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promisethat I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he hasplayed me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argoswith the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laidmany a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for hispower is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that anAchaean host, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain againstmen fewer in number than themselves; but as yet the end is not insight. Think that the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemncovenant, and that they have each been numbered- the Trojans by theroll of their householders, and we by companies of ten; thinkfurther that each of our companies desired to have a Trojanhouseholder to pour out their wine; we are so greatly more in numberthat full many a company would have to go without its cup-bearer.But they have in the town allies from other places, and it is thesethat hinder me from being able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine ofJove years are gone; the timbers of our ships have rotted; theirtackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home lookanxiously for our coming, but the work that we came hither to do hasnot been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say: let us sailback to our own land, for we shall not take Troy."

　　With these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many ofthem as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged toand fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and southwinds break from heaven's clouds to lash them; or as when the westwind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast,even so were they swayed as they flew with loud cries towards theships, and the dust from under their feet rose heavenward. Theycheered each other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared thechannels in front of them; they began taking away the stays fromunderneath them, and the welkin rang with their glad cries, so eagerwere they to return.

　　Then surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that wasnot fated. But Juno said to Minerva, "Alas, daughter ofaegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to theirown land over the broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the gloryof still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans havedied at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host,and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their shipsinto the sea."

　　Minerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from thetopmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships ofthe Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel,standing alone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for hewas grieved and sorry; so she went close up to him and said, "Ulysses,noble son of Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into yourships and be off home to your own land in this way? Will you leavePriam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sakeso many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Goabout at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man,that they draw not their ships into the sea."

　　Ulysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloakfrom him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca,who waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses wentstraight up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral,imperishable staff. With this he went about among the ships of theAchaeans.

　　Whenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke himfairly. "Sir," said he, "this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Standto your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do notyet know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and erelong will visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not allof us at the council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he beangry and do us a mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and thehand of Jove is with them."

　　But when he came across any common man who was making a noise, hestruck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, "Sirrah, holdyour peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a cowardand no soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannotall be kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; oneman must be supreme- one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn hasgiven the sceptre of sovereignty over you all."

　　Thus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the peoplehurried back to the council from their tents and ships with a sound asthe thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, andall the sea is in an uproar.

　　The rest now took their seats and kept to their own severalplaces, but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue- aman of many words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, arailer against all who were in authority, who cared not what hesaid, so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliestman of all those that came before Troy- bandy-legged, lame of onefoot, with his two shoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. Hishead ran up to a point, but there was little hair on the top of it.Achilles and Ulysses hated him worst of all, for it was with them thathe was most wont to wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voicehe began heaping his abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry anddisgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling and bawling at theson of Atreus.

　　"Agamemnon," he cried, "what ails you now, and what more do youwant? Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, forwhenever we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you haveyet more gold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for hisson, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it someyoung girl to hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler ofthe Achaeans, should bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards,women rather than men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here atTroy to stew in his own meeds of honour, and discover whether wewere of any service to him or no. Achilles is a much better man thanhe is, and see how he has treated him- robbing him of his prize andkeeping it himself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if hedid, son of Atreus, you would never again insult him."

　　Thus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him andrebuked him sternly. "Check your glib tongue, Thersites," said be,"and babble not a word further. Chide not with princes when you havenone to back you. There is no viler creature come before Troy with thesons of Atreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile themnor keep harping about going home. We do not yet know how things aregoing to be, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with goodsuccess or evil. How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaanshave awarded him so many prizes? I tell you, therefore- and it shallsurely be- that if I again catch you talking such nonsense, I willeither forfeit my own head and be no more called father of Telemachus,or I will take you, strip you stark naked, and whip you out of theassembly till you go blubbering back to the ships."

　　On this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders tillhe dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody wealon his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish ashe wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him, yetthey laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying,"Ulysses has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council,but he never did the Argives a better turn than when he stopped thisfellow's mouth from prating further. He will give the kings no more ofhis insolence."

　　Thus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, andMinerva in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, thatthose who were far off might hear him and consider his council. Hetherefore with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:-

　　"King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among allmankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set outfrom Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town ofTroy, and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would setoff homeward. True it is that they have had toil enough to bedisheartened. A man chafes at having to stay away from his wife evenfor a single month, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of windand sea, but it is now nine long years that we have been kept here;I cannot, therefore, blame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still weshall be shamed if we go home empty after so long a stay- therefore,my friends, be patient yet a little longer that we may learn whetherthe prophesyings of Calchas were false or true.

　　"All who have not since perished must remember as though it wereyesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans weredetained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war onPriam and the Trojans. We were ranged round about a fountainoffering hecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there was afine plane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of purewater. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out ofthe ground, with blood-red stains upon its back, and it darted fromunder the altar on to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of youngsparrows, quite small, upon the topmost bough, peeping out fromunder the leaves, eight in all, and their mother that hatched themmade nine. The serpent ate the poor cheeping things, while the oldbird flew about lamenting her little ones; but the serpent threw hiscoils about her and caught her by the wing as she was screaming. Then,when he had eaten both the sparrow and her young, the god who had senthim made him become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turnedhim into stone, and we stood there wondering at that which had come topass. Seeing, then, that such a fearful portent had broken in upon ourhecatombs, Calchas forthwith declared to us the oracles of heaven.'Why, Achaeans,' said he, 'are you thus speechless? Jove has sent usthis sign, long in coming, and long ere it be fulfilled, though itsfame shall last for ever. As the serpent ate the eight fledglingsand the sparrow that hatched them, which makes nine, so shall we fightnine years at Troy, but in the tenth shall take the town.' This waswhat he said, and now it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, allof you, till we take the city of Priam."

　　On this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again withthe uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. "Shame onyou," he cried, "to stay talking here like children, when you shouldfight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oathsthat we have taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, withour drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein wehave put our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all ourtalking here shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son ofAtreus, by your own steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on tobattle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and schemein vain, to get back to Argos ere they have learned whether Jove betrue or a liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that weshould succeed, when we Argives set sail to bring death anddestruction upon the Trojans. He showed us favourable signs byflashing his lightning on our right hands; therefore let none makehaste to go till he has first lain with the wife of some Trojan, andavenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the sake ofHelen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such haste to be at homeagain, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom inthe sight of all. But, O king, consider and give ear to my counsel,for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide your men,Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans andtribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if theAchaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples, arebrave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the other.Thus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel ofheaven or the cowardice of man that you shall fail to take the town."

　　And Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, you have again outdone the sonsof the Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, andApollo, that I had among them ten more such councillors, for thecity of King Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and weshould sack it. But the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootlesswranglings and strife. Achilles and I are quarrelling about this girl,in which matter I was the first to offend; if we can be of one mindagain, the Trojans will not stave off destruction for a day. Now,therefore, get your morning meal, that our hosts join in fight. Whetwell your spears; see well to the ordering of your shields; givegood feeds to your horses, and look your chariots carefully over, thatwe may do battle the livelong day; for we shall have no rest, notfor a moment, till night falls to part us. The bands that bear yourshields shall be wet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your handsshall weary upon your spears, your horses shall steam in front of yourchariots, and if I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keepout of it at the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shallbe a prey to dogs and vultures."

　　Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the wavesrun high before the blast of the south wind and break on some loftyheadland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, asthe storms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeansrise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lightedtheir fires at their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice everyman to one or other of the gods, and praying each one of them thathe might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men,sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of Saturn, andinvited the princes and elders of his host. First he asked Nestorand King Idomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, andsixthly Ulysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his ownaccord, for he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood roundthe bull with the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed,saying, "Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, andridest upon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, northe night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gatesare consumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt ofHector about his heart, and that full many of his comrades may bitethe dust as they fall dying round him."

　　Thus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer.He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toilcontinually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-mealupon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayedit. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layersof fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These theyburned upon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inwardmeats, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-boneswere burned, and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the restup small, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done,and drew them off; then, when they had finished their work and thefeast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, sothat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat anddrink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. "King Agamemnon,"said he, "let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the workthat heaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds summon thepeople to gather at their several ships; we will then go about amongthe host, that we may begin fighting at once."

　　Thus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sentthe criers round to call the people in assembly. So they calledthem, and the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son ofAtreus chose their men and marshalled them, while Minerva went amongthem holding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death.From it there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftlywoven, and each one of them worth a hundred oxen. With this she dartedfuriously everywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, urging themforward, and putting courage into the heart of each, so that hemight fight and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeterin their eyes even than returning home in their ships. As when somegreat forest fire is raging upon a mountain top and its light isseen afar, even so as they marched the gleam of their armour flashedup into the firmament of heaven.

　　They were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on theplain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither andthither, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settletill the fen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribespour from ships and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and theground rang as brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood asthick upon the flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in summer.

　　As countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman's homestead inthe time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even sodid the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans anddestroy them.

　　The chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fightbegan, drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flockswhen they have got mixed while feeding; and among them went KingAgamemnon, with a head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waistlike Mars, and a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull thatlords it over the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make theson of Atreus stand peerless among the multitude of heroes.

　　And now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me-for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see allthings, while we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs andprinces of the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were sothat I could not name every single one of them though I had tentongues, and though my voice failed not and my heart were of bronzewithin me, unless you, O Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearingJove, were to recount them to me. Nevertheless, I will tell thecaptains of the ships and all the fleet together.

　　Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius werecaptains of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria androcky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands ofEteonus, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. Theyalso held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, andPeteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, andThisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus;Plataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestuswith its famous grove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea,sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fiftyships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men of theBoeotians.

　　Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dweltin Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noblemaiden bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she hadgone with Mars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain withher. With these there came thirty ships.

　　The Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mightyIphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus,rocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt inAnemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus,and Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains cameforty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, whichwere stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.

　　Ajax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not sogreat, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was alittle man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of thespear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt inCynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, andThronium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty shipsof the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea.

　　The fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,Histiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perchedtown of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra;Elephenor of the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son ofChalcodon, and chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleetof foot and wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, whowould ever strive to tear open the corslets of their foes with theirlong ashen spears. Of these there came fifty ships.

　　And they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of greatErechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove's daughter,Minerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own richsanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him withsacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus,son of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the marshalling ofchariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone rival him, for he wasolder. With him there came fifty ships.

　　Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongsidethose of the Athenians.

　　The men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns,with Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and thevineyard lands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who camefrom Aegina and Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loudbattle-cry, and Sthenelus son of famed Capaneus. With them incommand was Euryalus, son of king Mecisteus, son of Talaus; but Diomedwas chief over them all. With these there came eighty ships.

　　Those who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae;Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old;Hyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-landround about Helice; these sent a hundred ships under the command ofKing Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was far both finest andmost numerous, and in their midst was the king himself, all gloriousin his armour of gleaming bronze- foremost among the heroes, for hewas the greatest king, and had most men under him.

　　And those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills,Pharis, Sparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae,Amyclae, and Helos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; thesewere led by Menelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, andof them there were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others.Among them went Menelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men tofight; for he longed to avenge the toil and sorrow that he hadsuffered for the sake of Helen.

　　The men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of theriver Alpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum,Helos, and Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled hisminstrelsy for ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytuslived and reigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses,daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing against him;whereon they were angry, and maimed him. They robbed him of his divinepower of song, and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. Thesewere commanded by Nestor, knight of Gerene, and with him there cameninety ships.

　　And those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene,near the tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the menof Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie,and bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus andParrhasia; of these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, andthey had sixty ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in eachone of them, but Agamemnon found them the ships in which to crossthe sea, for they were not a people that occupied their businessupon the waters.

　　The men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as isenclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rockOlene and Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had tenships, with many Epeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachusand Thalpius- the one, son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus- bothof the race of Actor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynces,and Polyxenus, son of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas.

　　And those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dweltbeyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, andthe son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with hisfather, and went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came fortyships.

　　Ulysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum withits forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, withthe mainland also that was over against the islands. These were led byUlysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelveships.

　　Thoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt inPleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, forthe great king Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, aswas also golden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetoliansto be their king. And with Thoas there came forty ships.

　　The famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,and the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus andLycastus that lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestusand Rhytium, with the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred citiesof Crete. All these were led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer ofmurderous Mars. And with these there came eighty ships.

　　Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large ofstature, brought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. Thesedwelt in Rhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindus,Ielysus, and Cameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These werecommanded by Tlepolemus, son of Hercules by Astyochea, whom he hadcarried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, after sacking manycities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemus grew up, he killed hisfather's uncle Licymnius, who had been a famous warrior in his time,but was then grown old. On this he built himself a fleet, gathered agreat following, and fled beyond the sea, for he was menaced by theother sons and grandsons of Hercules. After a voyage. during whichhe suffered great hardship, he came to Rhodes, where the peopledivided into three communities, according to their tribes, and weredearly loved by Jove, the lord, of gods and men; wherefore the sonof Saturn showered down great riches upon them.

　　And Nireus brought three ships from Syme- Nireus, who was thehandsomest man that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after theson of Peleus- but he was a man of no substance, and had but a smallfollowing.

　　And those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, thecity of Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commandedby Pheidippus and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son ofHercules. And with them there came thirty ships.

　　Those again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; andthose of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were calledMyrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over whichAchilles was in command. But they now took no part in the war,inasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed byhis ships, furious about the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he hadtaken from Lyrnessus at his own great peril, when he had sackedLyrnessus and Thebe, and had overthrown Mynes and Epistrophus, sons ofking Evenor, son of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still grieving,but ere long he was again to join them.

　　And those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus,sanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea,and Pteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaushad been captain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying underthe earth. He had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeksin sorrow, and his house was only half finished, for he was slain by aDardanian warrior while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soilof Troy. Still, though his people mourned their chieftain, they werenot without a leader, for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalledthem; he was son of Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son ofPhylacus, and he was own brother to Protesilaus, only younger,Protesilaus being at once the elder and the more valiant. So thepeople were not without a leader, though they mourned him whom theyhad lost. With him there came forty ships.

　　And those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe,Glaphyrae, and the populous city of Iolcus, these with their elevenships were led by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore tohim, loveliest of the daughters of Pelias.

　　And those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea andrugged Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, andthey had seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them goodarchers; but Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the Island ofLemnos, where the sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had beenbitten by a poisonous water snake. There he lay sick and sorry, andfull soon did the Argives come to miss him. But his people, thoughthey felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon, the bastard sonof Oileus by Rhene, set them in array.

　　Those, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and theythat held Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these werecommanded by the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art ofhealing, Podalirius and Machaon. And with them there came thirtyships.

　　The men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia,with those that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus,these were led by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them therecame forty ships.

　　Those that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the whitecity of Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was sonof Pirithous, who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him toPirithous on the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountainsavages and drove them from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoeteswas not sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the race ofMars, who was son of Coronus, the son of Caeneus. And with these therecame forty ships.

　　Guneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followedby the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona,and held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sendsits waters into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silvereddies of the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for theTitaresius is a branch of dread Orcus and of the river Styx.

　　Of the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They werethey that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleetof foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.

　　Such were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, OMuse, was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those thatfollowed after the sons of Atreus?

　　Of the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest.They were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They wereof the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo,of the silver bow, had bred them in Perea- both of them mares, andterrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was muchthe foremost so long as Achilles' anger lasted, for Achillesexcelled him greatly and he had also better horses; but Achilles wasnow holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel withAgamemnon, and his people passed their time upon the sea shore,throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and in archery.Their horses stood each by his own chariot, champing lotus and wildcelery. The chariots were housed under cover, but their owners, forlack of leadership, wandered hither and thither about the host andwent not forth to fight.

　　Thus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groanedbeneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the landabout Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Evenso did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.

　　And now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the badnews among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young,at Priam's gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with thevoice of Priam's son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, wasstationed as watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes,to look out for any sally of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke,saying, "Old man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war isat hand. I have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such a hostas is now advancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city asthick as leaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you aboveall others, do as I say. There are many allies dispersed about thecity of Priam from distant places and speaking divers tongues.Therefore, let each chief give orders to his own people, settingthem severally in array and leading them forth to battle."

　　Thus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at oncebroke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates wereopened, and the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with thetramp as of a great multitude.

　　Now there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon theplain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb oflithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.

　　Priam's son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded theTrojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number andmost valiant of those who were longing for the fray.

　　The Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore toAnchises, when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon themountain slopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the twosons of Antenor, Archilochus and Acamas, both skilled in all thearts of war.

　　They that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men ofsubstance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are ofTrojan blood- these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollohad taught to use the bow.

　　They that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia,and the high mountain of Tereia- these were led by Adrestus andAmphius, whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Meropsof Percote, who excelled in all kinds of divination. He told themnot to take part in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate luredthem to destruction.

　　They that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, andArisbe- these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave commander-Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, ofthe breed that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.

　　Hippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt infertile Larissa- Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sonsof the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus.

　　Acamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and thosethat came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.

　　Euphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of theCiconian spearsmen.

　　Pyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by thebroad waters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the earth.

　　The Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes fromEnetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that heldCytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the riverParthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini.

　　Odius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distantAlybe, where there are mines of silver.

　　Chromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill inaugury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by thehand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slewothers also of the Trojans.

　　Phorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the farcountry of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray.

　　Mesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes,born to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dweltunder Mt. Tmolus.

　　Nastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These heldMiletus and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of theriver Maeander and the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These werecommanded by Nastes and Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He cameinto the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, hisgold was of no avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the handof the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and Achilles bore away his gold.

　　Sarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by theeddying waters of the Xanthus.

　　BOOK III

　　When the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,the Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that screamoverhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters ofOceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and theywrangle in the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently,in high heart, and minded to stand by one another.

　　As when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountaintops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a mancan see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dustfrom under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.

　　When they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward aschampion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of apanther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shodwith bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meethim in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before theranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase ofsome goat or horned stag, and devours it there and then, though dogsand youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his eyescaught sight of Alexandrus, for he deemed that now he should berevenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suitof armour.

　　Alexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank infear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts backaffrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon aserpent in some mountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into thethrong of Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the sonAtreus.

　　Then Hector upbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris,fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you hadnever been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live tobe disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at usand say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see butwho has neither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, getyour following together and sail beyond the seas? Did you not fromyour a far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people ofwarriors- to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and yourwhole country, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness toyourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what mannerof man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be yourlyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour,when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are aweak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stonesfor the wrongs you have done them."

　　And Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just. You arehard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves thetimber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge ofyour scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus hasgiven me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for thegods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for theasking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid theTrojans and Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in theirmidst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victoriousand prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bearthem to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peacewhereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the others gohome to Argos and the land of the Achaeans."

　　When Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among theTrojan ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, andthey all sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed athim with stones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying,"Hold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires tospeak."

　　They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. "Hearfrom my mouth," said he, "Trojans and Achaeans, the saying ofAlexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids theTrojans and Achaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he andMenelaus fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Lethim who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take thewoman and all she has, to bear them to his own home, but let therest swear to a solemn covenant of peace."

　　Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of theloud battle-cry addressed them. "And now," he said, "hear me too,for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting ofAchaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how muchhave suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he didme. Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more.Bring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth andSun, and we will bring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priamcome, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his sons arehigh-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must not betransgressed or taken in vain. Young men's minds are light as air, butwhen an old man comes he looks before and after, deeming that whichshall be fairest upon both sides."

　　The Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for theythought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariotstoward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying itdown upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with alittle space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city tobring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybiusto fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon hadsaid.

　　Meanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law,wife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, hadmarried Laodice, the fairest of Priam's daughters. She found her inher own room, working at a great web of purple linen, on which she wasembroidering the battles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars hadmade them fight for her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said,"Come hither, child, and see the strange doings of the Trojans andAchaeans till now they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lustof battle, but now they have left off fighting, and are leaning upontheir shields, sitting still with their spears planted beside them.Alexandrus and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you areto the the wife of him who is the victor."

　　Thus spoke the goddess, and Helen's heart yearned after her formerhusband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle overher head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone,but attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus,and Clymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.

　　The two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, wereseated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus,Clytius, and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old tofight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicalesthat chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood.When they saw Helen coming towards the tower, they said softly toone another, "Small wonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endureso much and so long, for the sake of a woman so marvellously anddivinely lovely. Still, fair though she be, let them take her andgo, or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children after us."

　　But Priam bade her draw nigh. "My child," said he, "take your seatin front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmenand your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you whoare to blame. It is they that have brought about this terrible warwith the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great andgoodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and soroyal. Surely he must be a king."

　　"Sir," answered Helen, "father of my husband, dear and reverend inmy eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come herewith your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darlingdaughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be,and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, thehero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and abrave soldier, brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to myabhorred and miserable self."

　　The old man marvelled at him and said, "Happy son of Atreus, childof good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in greatmultitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people ofOtreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the riverSangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peersof men, came up against them, but even they were not so many as theAchaeans."

　　The old man next looked upon Ulysses; "Tell me," he said, "who isthat other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across thechest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalksin front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering hisewes."

　　And Helen answered, "He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son ofLaertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner ofstratagems and subtle cunning."

　　On this Antenor said, "Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses oncecame here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I receivedthem in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight andconversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans,Menelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysseshad the more royal presence. After a time they delivered theirmessage, and the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; hedid not say much, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke veryclearly and to the point, though he was the younger man of the two;Ulysses, on the other hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silentand kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play norgraceful movement of his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like aman unpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for a merechurl or simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words camedriving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, thenthere was none to touch him, and no man thought further of what helooked like."

　　Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, "Who is that great andgoodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the restof the Argives?"

　　"That," answered Helen, "is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans,and on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneuslooking like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him.Often did Menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he camevisiting us from Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whosenames I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find,Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they arechildren of my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they havenot left Lacedaemon, or else, though they have brought their ships,they will not show themselves in battle for the shame and disgracethat I have brought upon them."

　　She knew not that both these heroes were already lying under theearth in their own land of Lacedaemon.

　　Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offeringsthrough the city- two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth;and Idaeus brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up toPriam and said, "Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans andAchaeans bid you come down on to the plain and swear to a solemncovenant. Alexandrus and Menelaus are to fight for Helen in singlecombat, that she and all her wealth may go with him who is the victor.We are to swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we othersshall dwell here in Troy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and theland of the Achaeans."

　　The old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke thehorses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat besidehim; they then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. Whenthey reached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left thechariot, and with measured pace advanced into the space between thehosts.

　　Agamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants broughton the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; theypoured water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreusdrew the dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs'heads; this the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaeanprinces, and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer."Father Jove," he cried, "that rulest in Ida, most glorious inpower, and thou oh Sun, that seest and givest ear to all things, Earthand Rivers, and ye who in the realms below chastise the soul of himthat has broken his oath, witness these rites and guard them, thatthey be not vain. If Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen andall her wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but if Menelauskills Alexandrus, let the Trojans give back Helen and all that shehas; let them moreover pay such fine to the Achaeans as shall beagreed upon, in testimony among those that shall be born hereafter.Aid if Priam and his sons refuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen,then will I stay here and fight on till I have got satisfaction."

　　As he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, andlaid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife hadreft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from themixing-bowl into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying,Trojans and Achaeans among one another, "Jove, most great andglorious, and ye other everlasting gods, grant that the brains of themwho shall first sin against their oaths- of them and their children-may be shed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wivesbecome the slaves of strangers."

　　Thus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, "Hear me, Trojansand Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: Idare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son andMenelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shallfall."

　　On this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. Hegathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the twothen went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, andcast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aimfirst. Meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayedsaying, "Father Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power,grant that he who first brought about this war between us may die, andenter the house of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide byour oaths."

　　Great Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their severalstations, each by his horses and the place where his arms werelying, while Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodlyarmour. First he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fittedwith ancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of hisbrother Lycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung hissilver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then hismighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought,with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and hegrasped a redoubtable spear that suited his hands. In like fashionMenelaus also put on his armour.

　　When they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strodefierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeanswere struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near oneanother on the measured ground, brandishing their spears, and eachfurious against the other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck theround shield of the son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it,for the shield turned its point. Menelaus next took aim, praying toFather Jove as he did so. "King Jove," he said, "grant me revenge onAlexandrus who has wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in agesyet to come a man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house ofhis host."

　　He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield ofAlexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirtby his flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life.Then the son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projectingpart of his helmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or fourpieces from his hand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, "FatherJove, of all gods thou art the most despiteful; I made sure of myrevenge, but the sword has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurledin vain, and I have not killed him."

　　With this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plumeof his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. Thestrap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, andMenelaus would have dragged him off to his own great glory had notJove's daughter Venus been quick to mark and to break the strap ofoxhide, so that the empty helmet came away in his hand. This heflung to his comrades among the Achaeans, and was again springing uponAlexandrus to run him through with a spear, but Venus snatched himup in a moment (as a god can do), hid him under a cloud of darkness,and conveyed him to his own bedchamber.

　　Then she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower withthe Trojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old womanwho used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, andof whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her byperfumed robe and said, "Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go tothe house; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty anddressed in gorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just comefrom fighting, but rather that he was going to a dance, or had donedancing and was sitting down."

　　With these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When shemarked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, andsparkling eyes, she marvelled at her and said, "Goddess, why do youthus beguile me? Are you going to send me afield still further to someman whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus hasjust vanquished Alexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back withhim. You are come here to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrusyourself; henceforth be goddess no longer; never let your feet carryyou back to Olympus; worry about him and look after him till he makeyou his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave- but me? I shallnot go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word amongall the women of Troy. Besides, I have trouble on my mind."

　　Venus was very angry, and said, "Bold hussy, do not provoke me; ifyou do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as Ihave loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans andAchaeans, and you shall come to a bad end."

　　At this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her andwent in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojanwomen.

　　When they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants setabout their work, but Helen went into her own room, and thelaughter-loving goddess took a seat and set it for her facingAlexandrus. On this Helen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down,and with eyes askance began to upbraid her husband.

　　"So you are come from the fight," said she; "would that you hadfallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. Youused to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear thanMenelaus. go, but I then, an challenge him again- but I shouldadvise you not to do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet himin single combat, you will soon all by his spear."

　　And Paris answered, "Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches.This time, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me;another time I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that willstand by me. Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Neveryet was I so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment- not evenwhen I first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you-not even when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in theisland of Cranae was I so enthralled by desire of you as now." On thishe led her towards the bed, and his wife went with him.

　　Thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreusstrode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and noman, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If theyhad seen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of themhated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men,spoke, saying, "Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. Thevictory has been with Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all herwealth, and pay such fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimonyamong them that shall be born hereafter."

　　Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.

　　BOOK IV

　　Now the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floorwhile Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and asthey pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down uponthe town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno,talking at her so as to provoke her. "Menelaus," said he, "has twogood friends among the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva ofAlalcomene, but they only sit still and look on, while Venus keepsever by Alexandrus' side to defend him in any danger; indeed she hasjust rescued him when he made sure that it was all over with him-for the victory really did lie with Menelaus. We must consider what weshall do about all this; shall we set them fighting anew or make peacebetween them? If you will agree to this last Menelaus can take backHelen and the city of Priam may remain still inhabited."

　　Minerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side byside hatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father,for she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, butJuno could not contain herself. "Dread son of Saturn," said she,"what, pray, is the meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to gofor nothing, and the sweat that I have sweated, to say nothing of myhorses, while getting the people together against Priam and hischildren? Do as you will, but we other gods shall not all of usapprove your counsel."

　　Jove was angry and answered, "My dear, what harm have Priam andhis sons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city ofIlius? Will nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eatPriam raw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have ityour own way then; for I would not have this matter become a bone ofcontention between us. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart,if ever I want to sack a city belonging to friends of yours, youmust not try to stop me; you will have to let me do it, for I amgiving in to you sorely against my will. Of all inhabited cities underthe sun and stars of heaven, there was none that I so much respectedas Ilius with Priam and his whole people. Equitable feasts werenever wanting about my altar, nor the savour of burning fat, whichis honour due to ourselves."

　　"My own three favourite cities," answered Juno, "are Argos,Sparta, and Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased withthem. I shall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, andtried to stay you, I should take nothing by it, for you are muchstronger than I am, but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am agod and of the same race with yourself. I am Saturn's eldest daughter,and am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I amyour wife, and you are king over the gods. Let it be a case, then,of give-and-take between us, and the rest of the gods will followour lead. Tell Minerva to go and take part in the fight at once, andlet her contrive that the Trojans shall be the first to break theiroaths and set upon the Achaeans."

　　The sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva,"Go at once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that theTrojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon theAchaeans."

　　This was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she dartedfrom the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky assome brilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as asign to mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of lightfollows in its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with aweas they beheld, and one would turn to his neighbour, saying, "Eitherwe shall again have war and din of combat, or Jove the lord ofbattle will now make peace between us."

　　Thus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus,son of Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to findPandarus, the redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standingamong the stalwart heroes who had followed him from the banks of theAesopus, so she went close up to him and said, "Brave son of Lycaon,will you do as I tell you? If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus youwill win honour and thanks from all the Trojans, and especially fromprince Alexandrus- he would be the first to requite you veryhandsomely if he could see Menelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain byan arrow from your hand. Take your home aim then, and pray to LycianApollo, the famous archer; vow that when you get home to your strongcity of Zelea you will offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in hishonour."

　　His fool's heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case.This bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed asit was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen asthe arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms long,and a worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them welldown, and giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung his bowhe laid it carefully on the ground, and his brave followers held theirshields before him lest the Achaeans should set upon him before he hadshot Menelaus. Then he opened the lid of his quiver and took out awinged arrow that had yet been shot, fraught with the pangs ofdeath. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian Apollo,the famous archer, vowing that when he got home to his strong cityof Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.He laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drewboth notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near thebow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly, andthe bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly onover the heads of the throng.

　　But the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove'sdaughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before theeand ward off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as amother whisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly;she guided it to the part where the golden buckles of the belt thatpassed over his double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struckthe belt that went tightly round him. It went right through this andthrough the cuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the beltbeneath it, which he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows;it was this that served him in the best stead, nevertheless thearrow went through it and grazed the top of the skin, so that bloodbegan flowing from the wound.

　　As when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to apiece of ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is tobe laid up in a treasure house- many a knight is fain to bear it,but the king keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and drivermay be proud- even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and yourlegs down to your fair ancles stained with blood.

　　When King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he wasafraid, and so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbsof the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaftwere still outside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaveda deep sigh as he held Menelaus's hand in his own, and his comradesmade moan in concert. "Dear brother, "he cried, "I have been the deathof you in pledging this covenant and letting you come forward as ourchampion. The Trojans have trampled on their oaths and have woundedyou; nevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offeringsand the right hands of fellowship in which have put our trust shallnot be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now,he. will yet fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with theirlives and with their wives and children. The day will surely come whenmighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam's people, whenthe son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them withhis awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This shallsurely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your lot nowto die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans willat once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory ofstill keeping Helen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie hereat Troy with your purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggartTrojan leap upon your tomb and say, 'Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak hisvengeance; he brought his army in vain; he is gone home to his ownland with empty ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.' Thus willone of them say, and may the earth then swallow me."

　　But Menelaus reassured him and said, "Take heart, and do not alarmthe people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outerbelt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass andthe belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me."

　　And Agamemnon answered, "I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be evenso, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon itto relieve your pain."

　　He then said to Talthybius, "Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to thegreat physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately.Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to ourdismay, and to his own great glory."

　　Talthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying tofind Machaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriorswho had followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him andsaid, "Son of Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and seeMenelaus immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded himwith an arrow to our dismay and to his own great glory."

　　Thus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passedthrough the spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till theycame to the place where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying withthe chieftains gathered in a circle round him. Machaon passed into themiddle of the ring and at once drew the arrow from the belt, bendingits barbs back through the force with which he pulled it out. He undidthe burnished belt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt ofmail which the bronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen thewound, he wiped away the blood and applied some soothing drugs whichChiron had given to Aesculapius out of the good will he bore him.

　　While they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forwardagainst them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed thefight.

　　You would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly andunwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariotrich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son ofPtolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readinessagainst the time his limbs should weary of going about and givingorders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he sawmen hasting to the front he stood by them and cheered them on."Argives," said he, "slacken not one whit in your onset; father Jovewill be no helper of liars; the Trojans have been the first to breaktheir oaths and to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured ofvultures; we shall take their city and carry off their wives andchildren in our ships."

　　But he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined tofight. "Argives," he cried, "cowardly miserable creatures, have you noshame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can no longerscud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight? You are asdazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans reachthe sterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whetherthe son of Saturn will hold his hand over you to protect you?"

　　Thus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passingthrough the crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming roundIdomeneus, who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, whileMeriones was bringing up the battalions that were in the rear.Agamemnon was glad when he saw him, and spoke him fairly. "Idomeneus,"said he, "I treat you with greater distinction than I do any others ofthe Achaeans, whether in war or in other things, or at table. When theprinces are mixing my choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they haveeach of them a fixed allowance, but your cup is kept always fulllike my own, that you may drink whenever you are minded. Go,therefore, into battle, and show yourself the man you have been alwaysproud to be."

　　Idomeneus answered, "I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised youfrom the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we mayjoin battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon theircovenants. Death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they havebeen the first to break their oaths and to attack us."

　　The son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon thetwo Ajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when agoat-herd from some high post watches a storm drive over the deepbefore the west wind- black as pitch is the offing and a mightywhirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and drives his flockinto a cave- even thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a darkmass to battle under the Ajaxes, horrid with shield and spear. Gladwas King Agamemnon when he saw them. "No need," he cried, "to giveorders to such leaders of the Argives as you are, for of your ownselves you spur your men on to fight with might and main. Would, byfather Jove, Minerva, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are,for the city of Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and weshould sack it."

　　With this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speakerof the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, incompany with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherdof his people. He placed his knights with their chariots and horses inthe front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom hecould trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle,that they might fight whether they would or no. He gave his ordersto the knights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand,so as to avoid confusion. "Let no man," he said, "relying on hisstrength or horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly withthe Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken yourattack; but let each when he meets an enemy's chariot throw hisspear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men ofold took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they minded."

　　Thus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight,and King Agamemnon was glad. "I wish," he said to him, that your limbswere as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but age,the common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that ithad fallen upon some other, and that you were still young."

　　And Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, "Son of Atreus, I toowould gladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; butthe gods will not give us everything at one and the same time. I wasthen young, and now I am old; still I can go with my knights andgive them that counsel which old men have a right to give. Thewielding of the spear I leave to those who are younger and strongerthan myself."

　　Agamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,son of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were theAthenians loud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunningUlysses, with his sturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not yetheard the battle-cry, for the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had onlyjust begun to move, so they were standing still, waiting for someother columns of the Achaeans to attack the Trojans and begin thefighting. When he saw this Agamemnon rebuked them and said, "Son ofPeteos, and you other, steeped in cunning, heart of guile, why standyou here cowering and waiting on others? You two should be of allmen foremost when there is hard fighting to be done, for you areever foremost to accept my invitation when we councillors of theAchaeans are holding feast. You are glad enough then to take your fillof roast meats and to drink wine as long as you please, whereas nowyou would not care though you saw ten columns of Achaeans engage theenemy in front of you."

　　Ulysses glared at him and answered, "Son of Atreus, what are youtalking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeansare in full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to doso, that the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremostof them. You are talking idly."

　　When Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly athim and withdrew his words. "Ulysses," said he, "noble son of Laertes,excellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor ordersto give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are ofa mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and ifany ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing."

　　He then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son ofTydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, withSthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began toupbraid him. "Son of Tydeus," he said, "why stand you cowering hereupon the brink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was everahead of his men when leading them on against the foe- so, at least,say they that saw him in battle, for I never set eyes upon him myself.They say that there was no man like him. He came once to Mycenae,not as an enemy but as a guest, in company with Polynices to recruithis forces, for they were levying war against the strong city ofThebes, and prayed our people for a body of picked men to help them.The men of Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but Jovedissuaded them by showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus,therefore, and Polynices went their way. When they had got as farthe deep-meadowed and rush-grown banks of the Aesopus, the Achaeanssent Tydeus as their envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered ingreat numbers to a banquet in the house of Eteocles. Stranger thoughhe was, he knew no fear on finding himself single-handed among somany, but challenged them to contests of all kinds, and in each one ofthem was at once victorious, so mightily did Minerva help him. TheCadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty youthswith two captains- the godlike hero Maeon, son of Haemon, andPolyphontes, son of Autophonus- at their head, to lie in wait forhim on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every man of them, saveonly Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven's omens. Such wasTydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he cannot fightas his father did."

　　Diomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon;but the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, "Son of Atreus,tell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boastourselves as even better men than our fathers; we took seven-gatedThebes, though the wall was stronger and our men were fewer in number,for we trusted in the omens of the gods and in the help of Jove,whereas they perished through their own sheer folly; hold not, then,our fathers in like honour with us."

　　Diomed looked sternly at him and said, "Hold your peace, myfriend, as I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge theAchaeans forward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, andhis the shame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us acquitourselves with valour."

　　As he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang sofiercely about his body that even a brave man might well have beenscared to hear it.

　　As when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the westwind has lashed it into fury- it has reared its head afar and nowcomes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest highover the jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions-even so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastlyto battle. The chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but themen said never a word; no man would think it, for huge as the hostwas, it seemed as though there was not a tongue among them, sosilent were they in their obedience; and as they marched the armourabout their bodies glistened in the sun. But the clamour of the Trojanranks was as that of many thousand ewes that stand waiting to bemilked in the yards of some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly inanswer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not one speech norlanguage, but their tongues were diverse, and they came from manydifferent places. These were inspired of Mars, but the others byMinerva- and with them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury nevertires, sister and friend of murderous Mars, who, from being at firstbut low in stature, grows till she uprears her head to heaven,though her feet are still on earth. She it was that went about amongthem and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow with even handbetween them.

　　When they were got together in one place shield clashed withshield and spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossedshields beat one upon another, and there was a tramp as of a greatmultitude- death-cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, andthe earth ran red with blood. As torrents swollen with rain coursemadly down their deep channels till the angry floods meet in somegorge, and the shepherd the hillside hears their roaring from afar-even such was the toil and uproar of the hosts as they joined inbattle.

　　First Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,son of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at theprojecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; thepoint of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes;headlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as hedropped King Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and captain of the proudAbantes began dragging him out of reach of the darts that were fallingaround him, in haste to strip him of his armour. But his purpose wasnot for long; Agenor saw him haling the body away, and smote him inthe side with his bronze-shod spear- for as he stooped his side wasleft unprotected by his shield- and thus he perished. Then the fightbetween Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flewupon each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.

　　Forthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius,son of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois,as she was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with herparents to see their flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but hedid not live to pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut offuntimely by the spear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breastby the right nipple as he was coming on among the foremost fighters;the spear went right through his shoulder, and he fell as a poplarthat has grown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere, and its topis thick with branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its rootsthat he may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, andit lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell toearth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the gleamingcorslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid the crowdand missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of Ulysses, inthe groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over to the otherside; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it. Ulysseswas furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armourthrough the front ranks till he was quite close; then he glaredround about him and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he didso. His dart was not sped in vain, for it struck Democoon, the bastardson of Priam, who had come to him from Abydos, where he had chargeof his father's mares. Ulysses, infuriated by the death of hiscomrade, hit him with his spear on one temple, and the bronze pointcame through on the other side of his forehead. Thereon darknessveiled his eyes, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fellheavily to the ground. Hector, and they that were in front, thengave round while the Argives raised a shout and drew off the dead,pressing further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down fromPergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was displeased."Trojans," he cried, "rush on the foe, and do not let yourselves bethus beaten by the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor iron thatwhen hit them you do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son oflovely Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger at theships."

　　Thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, whileJove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the hostof the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld themslackening.

　　Then fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struckby a jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled itwas Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had comefrom Aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed by thepitiless stone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his deaththroes stretched out his hands towards his comrades. But Peirous,who had wounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into hisbelly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon the ground, anddarkness veiled his eyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of Aetoliastruck him in the chest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself inhis lungs. Thoas came close up to him, pulled the spear out of hischest, and then drawing his sword, smote him in the middle of thebelly so that he died; but he did not strip him of his armour, for hisThracian comrades, men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top oftheir heads, stood round the body and kept him off with their longspears for all his great stature and valour; so he was driven back.Thus the two corpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, theone captain of the Thracians and the other of the Epeans; and manyanother fell round them.

　　And now no man would have made light of the fighting if he couldhave gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minervaleading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spearsand arrows. For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretchedside by side face downwards upon the earth.

　　BOOK V

　　Then Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son ofTydeus, that he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himselfwith glory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmetlike the star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath inthe waters of Oceanus- even such a fire did she kindle upon his headand shoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly ofthe fight.

　　Now there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,priest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus andIdaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two cameforward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he beingon foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close upto one another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went overDiomed's left shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and hisspear sped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near thenipple, and he fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare tobestride his brother's body, but sprang from the chariot and took toflight, or he would have shared his brother's fate; whereon Vulcansaved him by wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his oldfather might not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son ofTydeus drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take themto the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons ofDares, one of them in fright and the other lying dead by hischariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by the hand and said, "Mars,Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of cities, may we not nowleave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out, and see to which ofthe two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go away, and thusavoid his anger."

　　So saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down uponthe steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove theTrojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. FirstKing Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from hischariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,just as he was turning in flight; it struck him between theshoulders and went right through his chest, and his armour rangrattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.

　　Then Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who hadcome from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder ashe was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshroudedhim as he fell heavily from the car.

　　The squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, whileMenelaus, son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, amighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself hadtaught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred inmountain forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in archery couldnow save him, for the spear of Menelaus struck him in the back as hewas flying; it struck him between the shoulders and went right throughhis chest, so that he fell headlong and his armour rang rattling roundhim.

　　Meriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son ofHermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunningworkmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was thatmade the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of allmischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrushimself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtookhim as he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The pointof the spear went through the bone into the bladder, and death cameupon him as he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.

　　Meges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he wasa bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children,for the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close upto him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went underhis tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and felldead in the dust.

　　And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of nobleDolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and washonoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gavehim chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword uponthe arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody handfell to the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man canwithstand, came over his eyes.

　　Thus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son ofTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans orthe Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that hasburst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitfulvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven,but in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field wastethat many a strong man hand has reclaimed- even so were the densephalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and manythough they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.

　　Now when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and drivingthe Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit thefront part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went rightthrough the metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass wascovered with blood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph,"Knights Trojans, come on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, andhe will not hold out much longer if King Apollo was indeed with mewhen I sped from Lycia hither."

　　Thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrewand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus."Dear son of Capaneus," said he, "come down from your chariot, anddraw the arrow out of my shoulder."

　　Sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from thewound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that hadbeen made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, "Hear me, daughterof aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father welland stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grantme to come within a spear's throw of that man and kill him. He hasbeen too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boastingthat I shall not see the light of the sun much longer."

　　Thus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbssupple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close tohim and said, "Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, forI have set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus.Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know godsand men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers youbattle, do not fight him; but should Jove's daughter Venus come,strike her with your spear and wound her."

　　When she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeusagain took his place among the foremost fighters, three times morefierce even than he had been before. He was like a lion that somemountain shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing overthe wall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd hasroused the brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takesshelter under cover of the buildings, while the sheep,panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in heaps one on top ofthe other, and the angry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall. Eventhus did Diomed go furiously about among the Trojans.

　　He killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with athrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other witha sword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from hisneck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abasand Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they nevercame back for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed madean end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the twosons of Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now wornout with age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. ButDiomed took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly,for he nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmendivided his wealth among themselves.

　　Then he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, asthey were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastenson the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in acoppice. For all their vain struggles he flung them both from theirchariot and stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gavetheir horses to his comrades to take them back to the ships.

　　When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he wentthrough the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could findPandarus. When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said,"Pandarus, where is now your bow, your winged arrows, and yourrenown as an archer, in respect of which no man here can rival you noris there any in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands toJove and send an arrow at this fellow who is going so masterfullyabout, and has done such deadly work among the Trojans. He haskilled many a brave man- unless indeed he is some god who is angrywith the Trojans about their sacrifices, and and has set his handagainst them in his displeasure."

　　And the son of Lycaon answered, "Aeneas, I take him for none otherthan the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of hishelmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but ifhe is the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc withoutheaven's help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloudof darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I havetaken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrowwent through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure Ishould send him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that Ihave not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me.Moreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father's stablesthere are eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quitenew, with cloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand apair of horses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged meagain and again when I was at home and on the point of starting, totake chariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans inbattle, but I would not listen to him; it would have been muchbetter if I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses, whichhad been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a greatgathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home andcame on foot to Ilius armed only with my bow and arrows. These itseems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains, thesons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, Ihave only made them still more furious. I did ill to take my bowdown from its peg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius inHector's service, and if ever I get home again to set eyes on mynative place, my wife, and the greatness of my house, may some one cutmy head off then and there if I do not break the bow and set it on ahot fire- such pranks as it plays me."

　　Aeneas answered, "Say no more. Things will not mend till we two goagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial ofarms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros canspeed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. IfJove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry ussafely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reinswhile I stand upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man'sonset while I look after the horses."

　　"Aeneas." replied the son of Lycaon, "take the reins and drive; ifwe have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go betterfor their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when theyexpect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of thefight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take thehorses. Therefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him withmy spear."

　　They then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the sonof Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said toDiomed, "Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see twoheroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one askilful archer, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whosesire is Anchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and letus retreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you mayget killed."

　　Diomed looked angrily at him and answered: "Talk not of flight,for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neitherflight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind tomount, but will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids mebe afraid of no man, and even though one of them escape, theirsteeds shall not take both back again. I say further, and lay mysaying to your heart- if Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory ofkilling both, stay your horses here and make the reins fast to the rimof the chariot; then be sure you spring Aeneas' horses and drivethem from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. They are of the stockthat great Jove gave to Tros in payment for his son Ganymede, andare the finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises stolethe blood by putting his mares to them without Laomedon's knowledge,and they bore him six foals. Four are still in his stables, but hegave the other two to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we cantake them."

　　Thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up tothem, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. "Great and mighty son,"said he, "of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I willnow try with my spear."

　　He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struckthe shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it andpassed on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaonshouted out and said, "You are hit clean through the belly; you willnot stand out for long, and the glory of the fight is mine."

　　But Diomed all undismayed made answer, "You have missed, not hit,and before you two see the end of this matter one or other of youshall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood."

　　With this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on toPandarus's nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his whiteteeth; the bronze point cut through the root of his to tongue,coming out under his chin, and his glistening armour rang rattlinground him as he fell heavily to the ground. The horses started asidefor fear, and he was reft of life and strength.

　　Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear,fearing lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it asa lion in the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before himand a cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that shoulddare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so hugeand great that as men now are it would take two to lift it;nevertheless he bore it aloft with ease unaided, and with this hestruck Aeneas on the groin where the hip turns in the joint that iscalled the "cup-bone." The stone crushed this joint, and broke boththe sinews, while its jagged edges tore away all the flesh. The herofell on his knees, and propped himself with his hand resting on theground till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes. And nowAeneas, king of men, would have perished then and there, had not hismother, Jove's daughter Venus, who had conceived him by Anchiseswhen he was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her twowhite arms about the body of her dear son. She protected him bycovering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest some Danaanshould drive a spear into his breast and kill him.

　　Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But theson of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed hadgiven him. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly,by binding the reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang uponAeneas's horses and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks.When he had so done he gave them over to his chosen comradeDeipylus, whom he valued above all others as the one who was mostlike-minded with himself, to take them on to the ships. He thenremounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and drove with allspeed in search of the son of Tydeus.

　　Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spearin hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddessesthat can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the wasterof cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, heflew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicatehand. The point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces hadwoven for her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palmof her hand, so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in theveins of the blessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the godsdo not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such asours, and are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall,but Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud ofdarkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast andkill him; and Diomed shouted out as he left her, "Daughter of Jove,leave war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguilingsilly women? If you meddle with fighting you will get what will makeyou shudder at the very name of war."

　　The goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet asthe wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin allbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,with his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereonshe fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let herhave his horses. "Dear brother," she cried, "save me, and give me yourhorses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badlywounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight evenwith father Jove."

　　Thus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. Shemounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside herand took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flewforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, wherethe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed themfrom the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venusflung herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her armsabout her and caressed her, saying, "Which of the heavenly beingshas been treating you in this way, as though you had been doingsomething wrong in the face of day?"

　　And laughter-loving Venus answered, "Proud Diomed, the son ofTydeus, wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom Ilove best of all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer onebetween Trojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken tofighting with the immortals."

　　"Bear it, my child," replied Dione, "and make the best of it. Wedwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men,and we lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otusand Ephialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so thathe lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars wouldhave then perished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons ofAloeus, told Mercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nighworn out by the severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered whenthe mighty son of Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with athree-barbed arrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also,did huge Hades, when this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hithim with an arrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly.Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry andfull of pain; and the arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him greatanguish till Paeeon healed him by spreading soothing herbs on thewound, for Hades was not of mortal mould. Daring, head-strong,evildoer who recked not of his sin in shooting the gods that dwellin Olympus. And now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus on againstyourself, fool that he is for not reflecting that no man who fightswith gods will live long or hear his children prattling about hisknees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus seethat he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than youare. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus,rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her weddedlord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans."

　　So saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter withboth hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. ButMinerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove withtheir mocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak. "Father Jove,"said she, "do not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian musthave been persuading some one of the Achaean women to go with theTrojans of whom she is so very fond, and while caressing one orother of them she must have torn her delicate hand with the gold pinof the woman's brooch."

　　The sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to hisside. "My child," said he, "it has not been given you to be a warrior.Attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, andleave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva."

　　Thus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though heknew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fearthe mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him ofhis armour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slayhim, and thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When hewas coming on for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apolloshouted to him with an awful voice and said, "Take heed, son ofTydeus, and draw off; think not to match yourself against gods, formen that walk the earth cannot hold their own with the immortals."

　　The son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid theanger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and sethim in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within themighty sanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious tobehold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in thelikeness of Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans andAchaeans hacked at the bucklers about one another's breasts, hewingeach other's round shields and light hide-covered targets. ThenPhoebus Apollo said to Mars, "Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stainedstormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus,who would now fight even with father Jove, and draw him out of thebattle? He first went up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the handnear her wrist, and afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were agod."

　　He then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Marswent about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in thelikeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. "Sons of Priam," saidhe, "how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by theAchaeans? Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneasthe son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour asHector himself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from thestress of the fight."

　　With these words he put heart and soul into them all. ThenSarpedon rebuked Hector very sternly. "Hector," said he, "where isyour prowess now? You used to say that though you had neither peoplenor allies you could hold the town alone with your brothers andbrothers-in-law. I see not one of them here; they cower as houndsbefore a lion; it is we, your allies, who bear the brunt of thebattle. I have come from afar, even from Lycia and the banks of theriver Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my infant son, and muchwealth to tempt whoever is needy; nevertheless, I head my Lyciansoldiers and stand my ground against any who would fight me though Ihave nothing here for the Achaeans to plunder, while you look on,without even bidding your men stand firm in defence of their wives.See that you fall not into the hands of your foes as men caught in themeshes of a net, and they sack your fair city forthwith. Keep thisbefore your mind night and day, and beseech the captains of yourallies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away theirreproaches from you."

　　So spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprangfrom his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about amongthe host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight andraising the terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and againfaced the Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and werenot driven back. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon somegoodly threshing-floor, when men are winnowing- while yellow Ceresblows with the wind to sift the chaff from the grain, and the chaff-heaps grow whiter and whiter- even so did the Achaeans whiten in thedust which the horses' hoofs raised to the firmament of heaven, astheir drivers turned them back to battle, and they bore down withmight upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help the Trojans, covered themin a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them,inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that when he saw Pallas,Minerva leave the fray he was to put courage into the hearts of theTrojans- for it was she who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollosent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his heart withvalour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who wereoverjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; butthey could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busywith the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably intheir midst.

　　The two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearlessof the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as cloudswhich the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when thereis no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous windswhose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions- even sodid the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. Theson of Atreus went about among them and exhorted them. "My friends,"said he, "quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in oneanother's eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonourmore often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither lifenor name."

　　As he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in thefront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom theTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was everquick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnonstruck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayedit not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly,and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to theground.

　　Then Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon andOrsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong cityof Phere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broadstream flows through the land of the Pylians. The river begatOrsilochus, who ruled over much people and was father to Diocles,who in his turn begat twin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, wellskilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew up, went toIlius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnonsons of Atreus, and there they both of them fell. As two lions whomtheir dam has reared in the depths of some mountain forest toplunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle till they get killedby the hand of man, so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, and felllike high pine-trees to the ground.

　　Brave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to thefront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Marsegged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed byAeneas; but Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward,fearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring all theirlabour to nothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were settingtheir hands and spears against one another eager to do battle,Antilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold thoughhe was, drew back on seeing the two heroes side by side in front ofhim, so they drew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks ofthe Achaeans and committed the two poor fellows into the hands oftheir comrades. They then turned back and fought in the front ranks.

　　They killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonianwarriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing onhis chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, theson of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him witha stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fellfrom his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struckhim on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from thechariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head andshoulders buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soiltill his horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, asAntilochus lashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.

　　But Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cryrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.Mars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoilof battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, nowin front of Hector and now behind him.

　　Diomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wideplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great riverrolling swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts backin fear- even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said tohis men, "My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spearso well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Marsis with him in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces thereforetowards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare notfight with gods."

　　As he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed inwar. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close upand hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man ofgreat wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, buthis lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajaxstruck him in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly,and he fell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him tostrip him of his armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him,many of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel upon thebody and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon himthat he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders. TheTrojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him withtheir spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiantthough he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.

　　Thus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the stronghand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man bothbrave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son andgrandson of great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spokefirst. "Sarpedon," said he, "councillor of the Lycians, why should youcome skulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call youson of aegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were ofold his children. Far other was Hercules, my own brave andlion-hearted father, who came here for the horses of Laomedon, andthough he had six ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked thecity of Ilius and made a wilderness of her highways. You are a coward,and your people are falling from you. For all your strength, and allyour coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but willpass the gates of Hades vanquished by my hand."

　　And Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, "Tlepolemus, yourfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon's folly in refusingpayment to one who had served him well. He would not give yourfather the horses which he had come so far to fetch. As foryourself, you shall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory tomyself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds."

　　Thus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threwat the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of histhroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fellupon his eyes. Tlepolemus's spear struck Sarpedon on the left thighwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone,but his father as yet warded off destruction from him.

　　His comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by theweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were insuch haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought ofdrawing the spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly.Meanwhile the Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereonUlysses was moved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheldthem. He doubted whether to pursue the son of Jove, or to makeslaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was not decreed, however,that he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, therefore, turned himagainst the main body of the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor,Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would haveslain yet more, had not great Hector marked him, and sped to the frontof the fight clad in his suit of mail, filling the Danaans withterror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him coming, and besought him,saying, "Son of Priam, let me not he here to fall into the hands ofthe Danaans. Help me, and since I may not return home to gladden thehearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die within the walls ofyour city."

　　Hector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once uponthe Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then boreSarpedon away and laid him beneath Jove's spreading oak tree. Pelagon,his friend and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedonfainted and a mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himselfagain, for the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave himnew life, and brought him out of the deep swoon into which he hadfallen.

　　Meanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships byMars and Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew thatMars was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces stillturned towards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to beslain by Mars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestesthe renowned charioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus,Helenus the son of Oenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, whowas possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake withthe other Boeotians who lived near him, owners of a fertile country.

　　Now when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she saidto Minerva, "Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, thepromise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he hadsacked the city of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars ragethus furiously. Let us go into the fray at once."

　　Minerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter ofgreat Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe withall speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were oneither side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were ofgold, imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze,wondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning roundthe axle upon either side. The car itself was made with plaitedbands of gold and silver, and it had a double top-rail running allround it. From the body of the car there went a pole of silver, onto the end of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands ofgold that were to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno put hersteeds under the yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry.

　　Meanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made withher own hands, on to her father's threshold, and donned the shirt ofJove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegisabout. her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, andon it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold;moreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim andawful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she sether helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both infront and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; thenshe stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stoutand sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes whohave displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates ofheaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates overwhich the flours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus,either to open the dense cloud that hides them, or to close it.Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found theson of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus.There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn,lord of all. "Father Jove," said she, "are you not angry with Mars forthese high doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans hehas destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason,while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease andsetting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I hope,Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, andchase him out of the battle."

　　And Jove answered, "Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him moreoften than any one else does."

　　Juno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flewforward nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man cansee when he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far canthe loud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. Whenthey reached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simoisand Scamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from thechariot. She hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosiaspring up for them to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying liketurtledoves in their eagerness to help the Argives. When they cameto the part where the bravest and most in number were gathered aboutmighty Diomed, fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength andendurance, there Juno stood still and raised a shout like that ofbrazen-voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty mentogether. "Argives," she cried; "shame on cowardly creatures, brave insemblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear wasso deadly that the Trojans dared not show themselves outside theDardanian gates, but now they sally far from the city and fight evenat your ships."

　　With these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minervasprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near hischariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. Forthe sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shieldirritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting upthe strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on theyoke of his horses and said, "The son of Tydeus is not such another ashis father. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushedmadly into the fray even when I told him not to do so. When he wentall unattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, Ibade him feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that highspirit which was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of theCadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, somightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and Ibid you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tiredout, or you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say thatyou are no true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus."

　　Diomed answered, "I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearingJove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out ofheart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following yourown instructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods;but if Jove's daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound herwith my spear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the otherArgives gather in this place, for I know that Mars is now lording itin the field."

　　"Diomed, son of Tydeus," replied Minerva, "man after my own heart,fear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I willbefriend you. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in closecombat; fear not this raging madman, villain incarnate, first on oneside and then on the other. But now he was holding talk with Junoand myself, saying he would help the Argives and attack the Trojans;nevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives."

　　With this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off thechariot on to the ground. In a second he was on the ground,whereupon the goddess mounted the car and placed herself by the sideof Diomed. The oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of theawful goddess and the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins,and drove straight at Mars. He was in the act of stripping hugePeriphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Marswas stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned the helmet ofHades, that he might not see her; when, therefore, he saw Diomed, hemade straight for him and let Periphas lie where he had fallen. Assoon as they were at close quarters he let fly with his bronze spearover the reins and yoke, thinking to take Diomed's life, but Minervacaught the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly over thechariot. Diomed then threw, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear intothe pit of Mars's stomach where his under-girdle went round him. ThereDiomed wounded him, tearing his fair flesh and then drawing hisspear out again. Mars roared as loudly as nine or ten thousand menin the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans and Trojans were struck withpanic, so terrible was the cry he raised.

　　As a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, evenso did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens.With all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in greatpain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove theimmortal blood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously,saying, "Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We godsare continually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another'shands while helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for havingbegotten that mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committingoutrage of some kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but heryou neither scold nor punish; you encourage her because thepestilent creature is your daughter. See how she has been incitingproud Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went upto the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then hesprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not run for it Imust either have lain there for long enough in torments among theghastly corpes, or have been eaten alive with spears till I had nomore strength left in me."

　　Jove looked angrily at him and said, "Do not come whining here,Sir Facing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus,for you are ever fighting and making mischief. You have theintolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I cando to manage her, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight:still, I cannot let you remain longer in such great pain; you are myown off-spring, and it was by me that your mother conceived you; if,however, you had been the son of any other god, you are so destructivethat by this time you should have been lying lower than the Titans."

　　He then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killingherbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. Asthe juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a momentthough it is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars.Then Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he tookhis seat by his father Jove all glorious to behold.

　　But Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put astop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the houseof Jove.

　　BOOK VI

　　THE fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as itwould, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain asthey aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the streamsof Simois and Xanthus.

　　First, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, brokea phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comradesby killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians,being both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projectingpeak of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his foreheadinto the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes.

　　Then Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived inthe strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had ahouse by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeitnot one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomedkilled both him and his squire Calesius, who was then hischarioteer- so the pair passed beneath the earth.

　　Euryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit ofAesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to nobleBucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard.While tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and sheconceived twin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and hestripped the armour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killedAstyalus, Ulysses Pidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fellby the spear of Nestor's son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men,killed Elatus who dwelt in Pedasus by the banks of the riverSatnioeis. Leitus killed Phylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus slewMelanthus.

　　Then Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for hishorses ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over theplain, and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards thecity along with the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out,and fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot;Menelaus came up to him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him bythe knees begging for his life. "Take me alive," he cried, "son ofAtreus, and you shall have a full ransom for me: my father is rich andhas much treasure of gold, bronze, and wrought iron laid by in hishouse. From this store he will give you a large ransom should hehear of my being alive and at the ships of the Achaeans."

　　Thus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to asquire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon camerunning up to him and rebuked him. "My good Menelaus," said he,"this is no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared sowell at the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one ofthem- not even the child unborn and in its mother's womb; let not aman of them be left alive, but let all in Ilius perish, unheeded andforgotten."

　　Thus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for hiswords were just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him,whereon King Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: thenthe son of Atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his spearfrom the body.

　　Meanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, "My friends, Danaanwarriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead,and bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we can;the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them laterat your leisure."

　　With these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now theTrojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had notPriam's son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas,"Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the Trojans andLycians, for you are foremost at all times, alike in fight andcounsel; hold your ground here, and go about among the host to rallythem in front of the gates, or they will fling themselves into thearms of their wives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you haveput heart into all our companies, we will stand firm here and fightthe Danaans however hard they press us, for there is nothing else tobe done. Meanwhile do you, Hector, go to the city and tell ourmother what is happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at thetemple of Minerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and openthe doors of the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva,let her lay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house- the oneshe sets most store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelveyearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple ofthe goddess, if she will take pity on the town, with the wives andlittle ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from falling onthe goodly city of Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men'ssouls with panic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not feareven their great champion Achilles, son of a goddess though he be,as we do this man: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is nonecan vie with him in prowess"

　　Hector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot,and went about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears,urging the men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle.Thereon they rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave ground andceased their murderous onset, for they deemed that some one of theimmortals had come down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, sostrangely had they rallied. And Hector shouted to the Trojans,"Trojans and allies, be men, my friends, and fight with might andmain, while I go to Ilius and tell the old men of our council andour wives to pray to the gods and vow hecatombs in their honour."

　　With this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went roundhis shield beat against his neck and his ancles.

　　Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into theopen space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When they wereclose up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first tospeak. "Who, my good sir," said he, "who are you among men? I havenever seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond allothers if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons facemy might. If, however, you are one of the immortals and have come downfrom heaven, I will not fight you; for even valiant Lycurgus, son ofDryas, did not live long when he took to fighting with the gods. He itwas that drove the nursing women who were in charge of frenziedBacchus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on theground as murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchushimself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him toher bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which theman reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry withLycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he livemuch longer after he had become hateful to the immortals. ThereforeI will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them thateat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your doom."

　　And the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me of mylineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees.Those of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when springreturns the forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with thegenerations of mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away.If, then, you would learn my descent, it is one that is well knownto many. There is a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land ofhorses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiestof all mankind. He was the son of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus,who was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the mostsurpassing comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, andbeing stronger than he, drove him from the land of the Argives, overwhich Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lustedafter him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; butBellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told liesabout him to Proteus. 'Proetus,' said she, 'kill Bellerophon or die,for he would have had converse with me against my will.' The kingwas angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him toLycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a foldedtablet, and containing much ill against the bearer. He badeBellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the end thathe might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia, and thegods convoyed him safely.

　　"When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the kingreceived him with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nineheifers in his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared uponthe tenth day, he questioned him and desired to see the letter fromhis son-in-law Proetus. When he had received the wicked letter hefirst commanded Bellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera,who was not a human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of alion and the tail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, andshe breathed forth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for hewas guided by signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famedSolymi, and this, he said, was the hardest of all his battles.Thirdly, he killed the Amazons, women who were the peers of men, andas he was returning thence the king devised yet another plan for hisdestruction; he picked the bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placedthem in ambuscade, but not a man ever came back, for Bellerophonkilled every one of them. Then the king knew that he must be thevaliant offspring of a god, so he kept him in Lycia, gave him hisdaughter in marriage, and made him of equal honour in the kingdom withhimself; and the Lycians gave him a piece of land, the best in all thecountry, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to have and to hold.

　　"The king's daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander,Hippolochus, and Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay withLaodameia, and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophoncame to be hated by all the gods, he wandered all desolate anddismayed upon the Alean plain, gnawing at his own heart, andshunning the path of man. Mars, insatiate of battle, killed his sonIsander while he was fighting the Solymi; his daughter was killed byDiana of the golden reins, for she was angered with her; butHippolochus was father to myself, and when he sent me to Troy he urgedme again and again to fight ever among the foremost and outvie mypeers, so as not to shame the blood of my fathers who were the noblestin Ephyra and in all Lycia. This, then, is the descent I claim."

　　Thus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He plantedhis spear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. "Then,"he said, you are an old friend of my father's house. Great Oeneus onceentertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchangedpresents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon adouble cup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do notremember Tydeus, for he was taken from us while I was yet a child,when the army of the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes.Henceforth, however, I must be your host in middle Argos, and you minein Lycia, if I should ever go there; let us avoid one another's spearseven during a general engagement; there are many noble Trojans andallies whom I can kill, if I overtake them and heaven delivers theminto my hand; so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whoselives you may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour,that all present may know of the old ties that subsist between us."

　　With these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped oneanother's hands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn madeGlaucus take leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour forbronze, the worth of a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.

　　Now when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wivesand daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to ask aftertheir sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set aboutpraying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.

　　Presently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned withcolonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers- all ofhewn stone- built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept,each with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side thecourtyard, there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone forPriam's daughters, built near one another, where his sons-in-law sleptwith their wives. When Hector got there, his fond mother came up tohim with Laodice the fairest of her daughters. She took his handwithin her own and said, "My son, why have you left the battle to comehither? Are the Achaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about thecity that you have thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jovefrom the citadel? Wait till I can bring you wine that you may makeoffering to Jove and to the other immortals, and may then drink and berefreshed. Wine gives a man fresh strength when he is wearied, asyou now are with fighting on behalf of your kinsmen."

　　And Hector answered, "Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unmanme and I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering toJove with unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood andfilth may not pray to the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, andgo with offerings to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there,upon the knees of Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you havein your house- the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, tosacrifice twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad,in the temple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, withthe wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeusfrom off the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights with fury, andfills men's souls with panic. Go, then, to the temple of Minerva,while I seek Paris and exhort him, if he will hear my words. Wouldthat the earth might open her jaws and swallow him, for Jove bredhim to be the bane of the Trojans, and of Priam and Priam's sons.Could I but see him go down into the house of Hades, my heart wouldforget its heaviness."

　　His mother went into the house and called her waiting-women whogathered the matrons throughout the city. She then went down intoher fragrant store-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, thework of Sidonian women, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidonwhen he sailed the seas upon that voyage during which he carried offHelen. Hecuba took out the largest robe, and the one that was mostbeautifully enriched with embroidery, as an offering to Minerva: itglittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. Withthis she went on her way and many matrons with her.

　　When they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughterof Cisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojanshad made her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their handsto the goddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay itupon the knees of Minerva, praying the while to the daughter ofgreat Jove. "Holy Minerva," she cried, "protectress of our city,mighty goddess, break the spear of Diomed and lay him low before theScaean gates. Do this, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers thathave never yet known the goad, in your temple, if you will have pityupon the town, with the wives and little ones If the Trojans." Thusshe prayed, but Pallas Minerva granted not her prayer.

　　While they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hectorwent to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built for him bythe foremost builders in the land. They had built him his house,storehouse, and courtyard near those of Priam and Hector on theacropolis. Here Hector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in hishand; the bronze point gleamed in front of him, and was fastened tothe shaft of the spear by a ring of gold. He found Alexandrus withinthe house, busied about his armour, his shield and cuirass, andhandling his curved bow; there, too, sat Argive Helen with herwomen, setting them their several tasks; and as Hector saw him herebuked him with words of scorn. "Sir," said he, "you do ill tonurse this rancour; the people perish fighting round this our town;you would yourself chide one whom you saw shirking his part in thecombat. Up then, or ere long the city will be in a blaze."

　　And Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just; listentherefore, and believe me when I tell you that I am not here so muchthrough rancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire toindulge my grief. My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, andI hold it better that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait,then, while I put on my armour, or go first and I will follow. I shallbe sure to overtake you."

　　Hector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. "Brother,"said she, "to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwindhad caught me up on the day my mother brought me forth, and hadborne me to some mountain or to the waves of the roaring sea thatshould have swept me away ere this mischief had come about. But, sincethe gods have devised these evils, would, at any rate, that I had beenwife to a better man- to one who could smart under dishonour and men'sevil speeches. This fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nornever will be, and he will surely reap what he has sown. Still,brother, come in and rest upon this seat, for it is you who bear thebrunt of that toil that has been caused by my hateful self and bythe sin of Alexandrus- both of whom Jove has doomed to be a theme ofsong among those that shall be born hereafter."

　　And Hector answered, "Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all thegoodwill you bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help theTrojans, who miss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge yourhusband, and of his own self also let him make haste to overtake mebefore I am out of the city. I must go home to see my household, mywife and my little son, for I know not whether I shall ever againreturn to them, or whether the gods will cause me to fill by the handsof the Achaeans."

　　Then Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did notfind Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of hermaids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within, hestood on the threshold of the women's rooms and said, "Women, tell me,and tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the house? Wasit to my sisters, or to my brothers' wives? or is she at the temple ofMinerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?"

　　His good housekeeper answered, "Hector, since you bid me tell youtruly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers' wives, noryet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiatingthe awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she hadheard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeanswere in great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and thenurse went with her carrying the child."

　　Hector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and wentdown the streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gonethrough the city and had reached the Scaean gates through which hewould go out on to the plain, his wife came running towards him,Andromache, daughter of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe under thewooded slopes of Mt. Placus, and was king of the Cilicians. Hisdaughter had married Hector, and now came to meet him with a nurse whocarried his little child in her bosom- a mere babe. Hector's darlingson, and lovely as a star. Hector had named him Scamandrius, but thepeople called him Astyanax, for his father stood alone as chiefguardian of Ilius. Hector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he didnot speak, and Andromache stood by him weeping and taking his handin her own. "Dear husband," said she, "your valour will bring you todestruction; think on your infant son, and on my hapless self whoere long shall be your widow- for the Achaeans will set upon you ina body and kill you. It would be better for me, should I lose you,to lie dead and buried, for I shall have nothing left to comfort mewhen you are gone, save only sorrow. I have neither father normother now. Achilles slew my father when he sacked Thebe the goodlycity of the Cilicians. He slew him, but did not for very shame despoilhim; when he had burned him in his wondrous armour, he raised a barrowover his ashes and the mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearingJove, planted a grove of elms about his tomb. I had seven brothersin my father's house, but on the same day they all went within thehouse of Hades. Achilles killed them as they were with their sheep andcattle. My mother- her who had been queen of all the land under Mt.Placus- he brought hither with the spoil, and freed her for a greatsum, but the archer- queen Diana took her in the house of your father.Nay- Hector- you who to me are father, mother, brother, and dearhusband- have mercy upon me; stay here upon this wall; make not yourchild fatherless, and your wife a widow; as for the host, place themnear the fig-tree, where the city can be best scaled, and the wallis weakest. Thrice have the bravest of them come thither andassailed it, under the two Ajaxes, Idomeneus, the sons of Atreus,and the brave son of Tydeus, either of their own bidding, or becausesome soothsayer had told them."

　　And Hector answered, "Wife, I too have thought upon all this, butwith what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if Ishirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save tofight bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown alikefor my father and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely comewhen mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam's people,but I grieve for none of these- not even for Hecuba, nor King Priam,nor for my brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust beforetheir foes- for none of these do I grieve as for yourself when the dayshall come on which some one of the Achaeans shall rob you for ever ofyour freedom, and bear you weeping away. It may be that you willhave to ply the loom in Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or tofetch water from the springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutallyby some cruel task-master; then will one say who sees you weeping,'She was wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojansduring the war before Ilius.' On this your tears will break forth anewfor him who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May Ilie dead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hearyour cry as they carry you into bondage."

　　He stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried andnestled in his nurse's bosom, scared at the sight of his father'sarmour, and at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from hishelmet. His father and mother laughed to see him, but Hector tookthe helmet from his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground.Then he took his darling child, kissed him, and dandled him in hisarms, praying over him the while to Jove and to all the gods."Jove," he cried, "grant that this my child may be even as myself,chief among the Trojans; let him be not less excellent in strength,and let him rule Ilius with his might. Then may one say of him as hecomes from battle, 'The son is far better than the father.' May hebring back the blood-stained spoils of him whom he has laid low, andlet his mother's heart be glad.'"

　　With this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, whotook him to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As herhusband watched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressedher fondly, saying, "My own wife, do not take these things toobitterly to heart. No one can hurry me down to Hades before my time,but if a man's hour is come, be he brave or be he coward, there isno escape for him when he has once been born. Go, then, within thehouse, and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, yourdistaff, and the ordering of your servants; for war is man's matter,and mine above all others of them that have been born in Ilius."

　　He took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went backagain to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towardshim. When she reached her home she found her maidens within, andbade them all join in her lament; so they mourned Hector in his ownhouse though he was yet alive, for they deemed that they shouldnever see him return safe from battle, and from the furious hands ofthe Achaeans.

　　Paris did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodlyarmour overlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast ashis feet could take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose andgallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont tobathe in the fair-flowing river- he holds his head high, and hismane streams upon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flieslike the wind to the haunts and feeding ground of the mares- even sowent forth Paris from high Pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in hisarmour, and he laughed aloud as he sped swiftly on his way.Forthwith he came upon his brother Hector, who was then turning awayfrom the place where he had held converse with his wife, and he washimself the first to speak. "Sir," said he, "I fear that I have keptyou waiting when you are in haste, and have not come as quickly as youbade me."

　　"My good brother," answered Hector, you fight bravely, and no manwith any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But youare careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hearthe ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have sufferedmuch on your account. Let us be going, and we will make things righthereafter, should Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of ourdeliverance before ever-living gods of heaven in our own homes, whenwe have chased the Achaeans from Troy."

　　BOOK VII

　　WITH these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brotherAlexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends abreeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and havelaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even sowelcome was the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.

　　Thereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; helived in Ame, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and ofPhylomedusa. Hector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him deadwith a wound in the neck under the bronze rim of his helmet.Glaucus, moreover, son of Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hardhand-to-hand fight smote Iphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as hewas springing on to his chariot behind his fleet mares; so he fellto earth from the car, and there was no life left in him.

　　When, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of theArgives, she darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, andApollo, who was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for hewanted the Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, andKing Apollo son of Jove was first to speak. "What would you havesaid he, "daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sentyou hither from Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, andwould you incline the scales of victory in favour of the Danaans?Let me persuade you- for it will be better thus- stay the combat forto-day, but let them renew the fight hereafter till they compass thedoom of Ilius, since you goddesses have made up your minds todestroy the city."

　　And Minerva answered, "So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mindthat I came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me,then, how do you propose to end this present fighting?"

　　Apollo, son of Jove, replied, "Let us incite great Hector tochallenge some one of the Danaans in single combat; on this theAchaeans will be shamed into finding a man who will fight him."

　　Minerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel ofthe gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, "Hector son ofPriam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me thenpersuade you. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them taketheir seats, and challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet youin single combat. I have heard the voice of the ever-living gods,and the hour of your doom is not yet come."

　　Hector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among theTrojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, andthey all sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. ButMinerva and Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on fatherJove's high oak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat closeranged together, bristling with shield and helmet and spear. As whenthe rising west wind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow darkbeneath it, so sat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon theplain. And Hector spoke thus:-

　　"Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I amminded; Jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants tonothing, and foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either takethe towers of Troy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. Theprinces of the Achaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him,then, that will fight me stand forward as your champion againstHector. Thus I say, and may Jove be witness between us. If yourchampion slay me, let him strip me of my armour and take it to yourships, but let him send my body home that the Trojans and theirwives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead. In like manner, ifApollo vouchsafe me glory and I slay your champion, I will strip himof his armour and take it to the city of Ilius, where I will hang itin the temple of Apollo, but I will give up his body, that theAchaeans may bury him at their ships, and the build him a mound by thewide waters of the Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sailshis ship over the sea, 'This is the monument of one who died longsince a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.' Thus will one say,and my fame shall not be lost."

　　Thus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to declinethe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus roseand rebuked them, for he was angry. "Alas," he cried, "vain braggarts,women forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon usif no man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned everyman of you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and ingloriousin your places. I will myself go out against this man, but theupshot of the fight will be from on high in the hands of theimmortal gods."

　　With these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, yourlife would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for hewas far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprungupon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the righthand and said, "Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Bepatient in spite of passion, do not think of fighting a man so muchstronger than yourself as Hector son of Priam, who is feared by manyanother as well as you. Even Achilles, who is far more doughty thanyou are, shrank from meeting him in battle. Sit down your ownpeople, and the Achaeans will send some other champion to fightHector; fearless and fond of battle though he be, I ween his kneeswill bend gladly under him if he comes out alive from thehurly-burly of this fight."

　　With these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,whereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders.Then Nestor rose and spoke, "Of a truth," said he, "the Achaean landis fallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor andorator among the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house toquestion me concerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. Howwould it not grieve him could he hear of them as now quailing beforeHector? Many a time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soulmight leave his body and go down within the house of Hades. Would,by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were still young andstrong as when the Pylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by therapid river Celadon under the walls of Pheia, and round about thewaters of the river Iardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stoodforward as their champion, with the armour of King Areithous uponhis shoulders- Areithous whom men and women had surnamed 'theMace-man,' because he fought neither with bow nor spear, but broke thebattalions of the foe with his iron mace. Lycurgus killed him, notin fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow way where his maceserved him in no stead; for Lycurgus was too quick for him and spearedhim through the middle, so he fell to earth on his back. Lycurgus thenspoiled him of the armour which Mars had given him, and bore it inbattle thenceforward; but when he grew old and stayed at home, he gaveit to his faithful squire Ereuthalion, who in this same armourchallenged the foremost men among us. The others quaked and quailed,but my high spirit bade me fight him though none other wouldventure; I was the youngest man of them all; but when I fought himMinerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the biggest and strongest manthat ever I killed, and covered much ground as he lay sprawling uponthe earth. Would that I were still young and strong as I then was, forthe son of Priam would then soon find one who would face him. But you,foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of you anystomach for fighting Hector."

　　Thus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men startedto their feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after himbrave Diomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, menclothed in valour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, andMeriones his brother in arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon,Thoas the son of Andraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then Nestorknight of Gerene again spoke, saying: "Cast lots among you to seewho shall be chosen. If he come alive out of this fight he will havedone good service alike to his own soul and to the Achaeans."

　　Thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and hadthrown it into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the peoplelifted their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as helooked into the vault of heaven, "Father Jove, grant that the lot fallon Ajax, or on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycenehimself."

　　As they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, andfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted- the lot of Ajax.The herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of theAchaeans, going from left to right; but they none of of them owned it.When, however, in due course he reached the man who had written uponit and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, andthe herald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw him mark he knew it and wasglad; he threw it to the ground and said, "My friends, the lot ismine, and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on myarmour; meanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselvesthat the Trojans may not hear you- or aloud if you will, for we fearno man. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for Iwas born and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things."

　　With this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thuswould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, "FatherJove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victoryto Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hectoralso and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame andprowess.

　　Thus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleamingbronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrousMars when he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting withone another- even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, springforward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his longspear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him,but the Trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hectorbeat quickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranksbehind him, for he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing hisshield in front of him like a wall- a shield of bronze with sevenfolds of oxhide- the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by farthe best worker in leather. He had made it with the hides of sevenfull-fed bulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze.Holding this shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up toHector, and menaced him saying, "Hector, you shall now learn, man toman, what kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besideslion-hearted Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides atthe ships in anger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but thereare many of us who are well able to face you; therefore begin thefight."

　　And Hector answered, "Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of thehost, treat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannotfight. I have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle.I am quick to turn my leathern shield either to right or left, forthis I deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among thechariots and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight theheart of Mars; howbeit I would not take such a man as you are offhis guard- but I will smite you openly if I can."

　　He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struckthe sevenfold shield in its outermost layer- the eighth, which wasof bronze- and went through six of the layers but in the seventhhide it stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the roundshield of the son of Priam. The terrible spear went through hisgleaming shield, and pressed onward through his cuirass of cunningworkmanship; it pierced the shirt against his side, but he swerved andthus saved his life. They then each of them drew out the spear fromhis shield, and fell on one another like savage lions or wild boars ofgreat strength and endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle ofAjax's shield, but the bronze did not break, and the point of his dartwas turned. Ajax then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector;the spear went through it and staggered him as he was springingforward to attack; it gashed his neck and the blood came pouringfrom the wound, but even so Hector did not cease fighting; he gaveground, and with his brawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, thatwas lying upon the plain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax onthe boss that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang again. ButAjax in turn caught up a far larger stone, swung it aloft, andhurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of a rock brokeHector's shield inwards and threw him down on his back with the shieldcrushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once. Thereon theywould have hacked at one another in close combat with their swords,had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come forward, one fromthe Trojans and the other from the Achaeans- Talthybius and Idaeusboth of them honourable men; these parted them with their staves,and the good herald Idaeus said, "My sons, fight no longer, you areboth of you valiant, and both are dear to Jove; we know this; butnight is now falling, and the behests of night may not be wellgainsaid."

　　Ajax son of Telamon answered, "Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it washe that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I willaccept his saying."

　　Then Hector said, "Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature andstrength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel allothers of the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting;hereafter we will fight anew till heaven decide between us, and givevictory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and thebehests of night may not be well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the heartsof the Achaeans at your ships, and more especially those of your ownfollowers and clansmen, while I, in the great city of King Priam,bring comfort to the Trojans and their women, who vie with one anotherin their prayers on my behalf. Let us, moreover, exchange presentsthat it may be said among the Achaeans and Trojans, 'They foughtwith might and main, but were reconciled and parted in friendship.'

　　On this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath andleathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed withpurple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans,and the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw theirhero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mightyAjax. They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had beensaved beyond their hopes. On the other side the Achaeans broughtAjax elated with victory to Agamemnon.

　　When they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnonsacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the sonof Saturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it intojoints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, puttingthem on the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing themoff. When they had done all this and had prepared the feast, theyate it, and every man had his full and equal share, so that all weresatisfied, and King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthwaysdown the loin, as a mark of special honour. As soon as they had hadenough to cat and drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truestbegan to speak; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, headdressed them thus:-

　　"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of theAchaeans are now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of theScamander, and their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, itwill be well when morning comes that we should cease fighting; we willthen wheel our dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not farfrom the ships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of ourcomrades home to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we willbuild a barrow that shall be raised from the plain for all incommon; near this let us set about building a high wall, to shelterourselves and our ships, and let it have well-made gates that theremay be a way through them for our chariots. Close outside we willdig a deep trench all round it to keep off both horse and foot, thatthe Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us."

　　Thus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile theTrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis bythe gates of King Priam's palace; and wise Antenor spoke. "Hear mehe said, "Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even asI am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons ofAtreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemncovenants, and shall not prosper till we have done as I say."

　　He then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose tospeak. "Antenor," said he, "your words are not to my liking; you canfind a better saying than this if you will; if, however, you havespoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of yourreason. I will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans thatI will not give up the woman; but the wealth that I brought homewith her from Argos I will restore, and will add yet further of myown."

　　On this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the raceof Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerityand goodwill addressed them thus: "Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, andallies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers nowas hitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful.At daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon andMenelaus sons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom thisquarrel has come about; and let him also be instant with them thatthey now cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fightanew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one or tothe other."

　　Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They tooksupper in their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his wa to theships. He found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the sternof Agamemnon's ship, and took his place in the midst of them. "Sonof Atreus," he said, "and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and theother noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying ofAlexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about, if so be that youmay find it acceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his shipsto Troy- would that he had sooner perished- he will restore, andwill add yet further of his own, but he will not give up the weddedwife of Menelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priambade me inquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn ourdead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between usand give victory to one or to the other."

　　They all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loudwar-cry spoke, saying, "Let there be no taking, neither treasure,nor yet Helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojansis at hand."

　　The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomedhad spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, "Idaeus, youhave heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But asconcerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men areonce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Jovethe mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant."

　　As he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods,and Idaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans andDardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when hecame, he stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon asthey heard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gatherthe corpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on their partalso hastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and othersto bring in wood.

　　The sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen intothe vault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, whenthe two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but theywashed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, andlifted them upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans towail aloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon thepyre, and having burned them went back to the city of Ilius. TheAchaeans in like manner heaped their dead sadly and silently on thepyre, and having burned them went back to their ships.

　　Now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of theAchaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that wasraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall toshelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates thatthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and closeoutside it they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it withinwith stakes.

　　Thus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jovethe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune,lord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, "Father Jove, what mortal inthe whole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you nothow the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven atrench all round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The Thefame of this wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will nolonger think anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself builtwith so much labour for Laomedon."

　　Jove was displeased and answered, "What, O shaker of the earth,are you talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might bealarmed at what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawnitself. Surely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships,you can shatter their wall and Ring it into the sea; you can cover thebeach with sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then beutterly effaced."

　　Thus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans wascompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got theirsupper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneusthe son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freightedthem with ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially tothe sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply theAchaeans bought their wine, some with bronze, some with iron, somewith hides, some with whole heifers, and some again with captives.They spread a goodly banquet and feasted the whole night through, asalso did the Trojans and their allies in the city. But all the timeJove boded them ill and roared with his portentous thunder. Palefear got hold upon them, and they spilled the wine from their cupson to the ground, nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings tothe most mighty son of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down torest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.

　　BOOK VIII

　　NOW when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuselight over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmostcrest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gaveear. "Hear me," said he, "gods and goddesses, that I may speak even asI am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to crossme, but obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to anend. If I see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans orDanaans, he shall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again toOlympus; or I will hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into thedeepest pit under the earth, where the gates are iron and the floorbronze, as far beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, thatyou may learn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and findout for yourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and layhold of it all of you, gods and goddesses together- tug as you will,you will not drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to earth;but were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth andsea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about somepinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament.So far am I above all others either of gods or men."

　　They were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he hadspoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, "Father, son ofSaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to begainsaid, but we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who areperishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you sobid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceablesuggestions to the Argives that they may not all of them perish inyour displeasure."

　　Jove smiled at her and answered, "Take heart, my child,Trito-born; I am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you."

　　With this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze andmanes of glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about thebody, seized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereonhe lashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixtearth and starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained Ida,mother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove andfragrant altar. There the father of gods and men stayed his horses,took them from the chariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then hetook his seat all glorious upon the topmost crests, looking downupon the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaeans.

　　The Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, andafterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewisearmed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers butnevertheless eager perforce to do battle for their wives and children.All the gates were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forthwith the tramp as of a great multitude.

　　When they were got together in one place, shield clashed withshield, and spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mightywas the din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another-death- cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earthran red with blood.

　　Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning theirweapons beat against one another, and the people fell, but when thesun had reached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his goldenscales, and put two fates of death within them, one for the Trojansand the other for the Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, andwhen he lifted it up the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraughtscale of the Achaeans settled down upon the ground, while that ofthe Trojans rose heavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, andsent the glare of his lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this,pale fear fell upon them and they were sore afraid.

　　Idomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the twoAjaxes, servants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerenealone stood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, butone of his horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen hadhit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane beginsto grow away from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded inhis anguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threwothers into confusion. The old man instantly began cutting thetraces with his sword, but Hector's fleet horses bore down upon himthrough the rout with their bold charioteer, even Hector himself,and the old man would have perished there and then had not Diomed beenquick to mark, and with a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.

　　"Ulysses," he cried, "noble son of Laertes where are you flyingto, with your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struckwith a spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defendNestor from this man's furious onset."

　　Ulysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of theAchaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into thethick of the fight took his stand before the horses of the son ofNeleus. "Sir," said he, "these young warriors are pressing you hard,your force is spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught,and your horses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what thehorses of Tros can do- how cleverly they can scud hither and thitherover the plain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from thehero Aeneas. Let our squires attend to your own steeds, but let usdrive mine straight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn howfuriously I too can wield my spear."

　　Nestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon thedoughty squires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor'shorses, while the two both mounted Diomed's chariot. Nestor took thereins in his hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close upwith Hector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he wascharging full speed towards them. He missed him, but struck hischarioteer and squire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breastby the nipple while the reins were in his hands, so that he died thereand then, and the horses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot.Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but lethim lie for all his sorrow, while he went in quest of anotherdriver; nor did his steeds have to go long without one, for hepresently found brave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made himget up behind the horses, giving the reins into his hand.

　　All had then been lost and no help for it, for they would havebeen penned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and menbeen quick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt whichfell just in front of Diomed's horses with a flare of burningbrimstone. The horses were frightened and tried to back beneath thecar, while the reins dropped from Nestor's hands. Then he was afraidand said to Diomed, "Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; seeyou not that the hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafesvictory to Hector; to-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grantit to ourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart the purpose ofJove, for he is far stronger than any."

　　Diomed answered, "All that you have said is true; there is a griefhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk amongthe Trojans and say, 'The son of Tydeus fled before me to theships.' This is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallowme."

　　"Son of Tydeus," replied Nestor, "what mean you? Though Hector saythat you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him,nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low."

　　So saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,and with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained theirdarts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, "Son of Tydeus,the Danaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place attable, the meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.Henceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better thana woman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale ourwalls through any Hinching upon my part; neither shall you carry offour wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand."

　　The son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn hishorses round again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thricedid Jove thunder from the heights of. Ida in token to the Trojans thathe would turn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted tothem and said, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of closefighting, be men, my friends, and fight with might and with main; Isee that Jove is minded to vouchsafe victory and great glory tomyself, while he will deal destruction upon the Danaans. Fools, forhaving thought of building this weak and worthless wall. It shallnot stay my fury; my horses will spring lightly over their trench, andwhen I am BOOK at their ships forget not to bring me fire that I mayburn them, while I slaughter the Argives who will be all dazed andbewildered by the smoke."

　　Then he cried to his horses, "Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethonand goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all thehoney-sweet corn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion hasfed you, and for she has mixed wine and water for you to drinkwhenever you would, before doing so even for me who am her ownhusband. Haste in pursuit, that we may take the shield of Nestor,the fame of which ascends to heaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rodsand all, and that we may strip from the shoulders of Diomed. thecuirass which Vulcan made him. Could we take these two things, theAchaeans would set sail in their ships this self-same night."

　　Thus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as sheshook with rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god ofNeptune, "What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you findno compassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring youmany a welcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then.If all of us who are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans backand keep Jove from helping them, he would have to sit there sulkingalone on Ida."

　　King Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, "Juno, rash oftongue, what are you talking about? We other gods must not setourselves against Jove, for he is far stronger than we are."

　　Thus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch,from the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses andwarriors, who were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now thatthe hand of Jove was with him. He would even have set fire to theships and burned them, had not Queen Juno put it into the mind ofAgamemnon, to bestir himself and to encourage the Achaeans. To thisend he went round the ships and tents carrying a great purple cloak,and took his stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses' ship, whichwas middlemost of all; it was from this place that his voice wouldcarry farthest, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son ofTelamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles- for these twoheroes, well assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn uptheir ships at the two ends of the line. From this spot then, with avoice that could be heard afar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying,"Argives, shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only;where are now our vaunts that we should prove victorious- the vauntswe made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate the flesh of hornedcattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? You vowed that youwould each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred men, andnow you prove no match even for one- for Hector, who will be erelong setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever so ruin agreat king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? yet, when to mysorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship pass your altarswithout offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every oneof them, so eager was I to sack the city of Troy. Vouchsafe me thenthis prayer- suffer us to escape at any rate with our lives, and letnot the Achaeans be so utterly vanquished by the Trojans."

　　Thus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed himthat his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle,most unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in itstalons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which theAchaeans sacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; When, therefore, thepeople saw that the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercelyupon the Trojans and fought more boldly.

　　There was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast thathe had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fightsooner than the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so heslew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon.He had turned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in theback midway between his shoulders and went right through his chest,and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from hischariot.

　　After him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the twoAjaxes clothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and hiscompanion in arms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylusthe brave son of Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took hisplace under cover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajaxlifted his shield Teucer would peer round, and when he had hit any onein the throng, the man would fall dead; then Teucer would hie backto Ajax as a child to its mother, and again duck down under hisshield.

　　Which of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, andthen Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlikeLycophontes, Amopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. these in turndid he lay low upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he sawhim making havoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to himand said, "Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captainamong the host, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans andthe glory of your father Telamon, who brought you up and took careof you in his own house when you were a child, bastard though youwere. Cover him with glory though he is far off; I will promise andI will assuredly perform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant meto sack the city of Ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honourafter my own- a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a womanwho shall go up into your bed."

　　And Teucer answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urgeme; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have neverceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot andkill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have beenburied in the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit."

　　As he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he wasbent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hitPriam's brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fairCastianeira, lovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, andnow he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it isweighed down by showers in spring- even thus heavy bowed his headbeneath the weight of his helmet.

　　Again he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and againhis arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector'sbrave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he wasdriving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as hefell headlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him.Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but forall his sorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brotherCebriones, who was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he hadsaid. Hector thereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to theground, and seizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intentkill him. Teucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and hadlaid it upon the bow-string, but Hector struck him with the jaggedstone as he was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder;he hit him just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest,a very deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that hiswrist was less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell forwardon his knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and runningtowards him bestrode him and sheltered him with his shield.Meanwhile his two trusty squires, Mecisteus son of Echius, andAlastor, came up and bore him to the ships groaning in his great pain.glad when he saw

　　Jove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove theAchaeans to their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at theirhead. As a hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when hegives him chase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so didHector follow close upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost asthey rushed panic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the setstakes and trench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the handsof the Trojans, they halted at their ships, calling upon one anotherand praying every man instantly as they lifted up their hands to thegods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyesglaring like those of Gorgo or murderous Mars.

　　Juno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said toMinerva, "Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take nomore thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we everdo so? See how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset ofbut a single man. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury,and has already done great mischief."

　　Minerva answered, "Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his ownland, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is madwith spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgetshow often I saved his son when he was worn out by the laboursEurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up toheaven, and then Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had thesense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house ofHades, to fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have comeback alive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jovehates me, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed hisknees and took hold of his beard, when she was begging him to dohonour to Achilles. I shall know what to do next time he beginscalling me his grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I gowithin the house of aegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; weshall then find out whether Priam's son Hector will be glad to meet usin the highways of battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds andvultures with the fat of their flesh as they he dead by the ships ofthe Achaeans."

　　Thus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,obeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizenedsteeds, while Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung herrichly vesture, made with her own hands, on to the threshold of herfather, and donned the shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle.Then she stepped into her flaming chariot, and grasped the spear sostout and sturdy and strong with which she quells the ranks ofheroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed her horses, and thegates of heaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord-gates over which the Hours preside, in whose hands are heaven andOlympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them or to closeit. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds.

　　But father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sentwinged Iris with a message to them. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, turnthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come tofighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this iswhat I mean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl themfrom their chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them allten years to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them;my grey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her fathermeans. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say shealways contradicts me."

　　With this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heightsof Ida to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at theouter gates of its many valleys and gave them her message. "What,"said she, "are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbidsgoing. This is what he says, and this is he means to do, he willlame your horses for you, he will hurl you from your chariot, and willbreak it in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal thewounds his lightning will inflict upon you, that you may learn,grey-eyed goddess, what quarrelling with your father means. He is lesshurt and angry with Juno, for whatever he says she alwayscontradicts him but you, bold bold hussy, will you really dare toraise your huge spear in defiance of Jove?"

　　With this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, "Of a truth,child of aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men's battlesfurther in defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will haveit, and let Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans andDanaans according to his own pleasure."

　　She turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made themfast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against theend wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upontheir golden thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but theywere very angry.

　　Presently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and enteredthe assembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked hishorses for him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it.Jove then sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneathhim. Minerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spokenor asked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said,"Minerva and Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killingso many of your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such isthe might of my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; youwere both of you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and itsterrible doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been- Ishould have struck you with lighting, and your chariots would neverhave brought you back again to Olympus."

　　Minerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side andbrooded mischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word,for she was in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against herfather; but Juno could not contain herself and said, "What, dreadson of Saturn, are you talking about? We know how great your power is,nevertheless we have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who areperishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you sobid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceablesuggestions to the Argives, that they may not all of them perish inyour displeasure."

　　And Jove answered, "To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,you will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of theArgives, for fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has rousedthe son of Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at theirships' sterns about the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this ishow it is decreed; for aught I care, you may go to the lowest depthsbeneath earth and sea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartaruswith neither ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may goon and on till you get there, and I shall not care one whit for yourdispleasure; you are the greatest vixen living."

　　Juno made him no answer. The sun's glorious orb now sank intoOceanus and drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were theTrojans when light failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed fordid darkness fall upon the Achaeans.

　　Then Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held acouncil on the open space near the river, where there was a spot earcorpses. They left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hearthe speech he made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, thebronze point of which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round thespear-head was of gold Spear in hand he spoke. "Hear me," said he,"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I shoulddestroy the ships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back toIlius, but darkness came on too soon. It was this alone that savedthem and their ships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obeythe behests of night, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out oftheir chariots and give them their feeds of corn; then make speed tobring sheep and cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn foryour horses and gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burnwatchfires whose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may tryto fly beyond the sea by night, and they must not embark scathelessand unmolested; many a man among them must take a dart with him tonurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is leaping on board hisship, that others may fear to bring war and weeping upon theTrojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about the city that thegrowing youths and grey-bearded men are to camp upon itsheaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a great fire inher house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be entered bysurprise while the host is outside. See to it, brave Trojans, as Ihave said, and let this suffice for the moment; at daybreak I willinstruct you further. I pray in hope to Jove and to the gods that wemay then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for 'tis thefates that have borne them and their ships hither. This night,therefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning let us put on ourarmour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall thenknow whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus will drive me back fromthe ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carryoff his bloodstained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle,abide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall beamong the first to fall and many another of his comrades round him.Would that I were as sure of being immortal and never growing old, andof being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this daywill bring evil to the Argives."

　　Thus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They tooktheir sweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast eachby his own chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from thecity, they brought wine also and corn from their houses and gatheredmuch wood. They then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals,and the wind carried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven- butthe blessed gods partook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Iliuswith Priam and Priam's people. Thus high in hope they sat throughthe livelong night by the highways of war, and many a watchfire didthey kindle. As when the stars shine clear, and the moon is bright-there is not a breath of air, not a peak nor glade nor juttingheadland but it stands out in the ineffable radiance that breaksfrom the serene of heaven; the stars can all of them be told and theheart of the shepherd is glad- even thus shone the watchfires of theTrojans before Ilius midway between the ships and the river Xanthus. Athousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of eachthere sat fifty men, while the horses, champing oats and corn besidetheir chariots, waited till dawn should come.

　　BOOK IX

　　THUS did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stainedRout, had taken fast hold of the Achaeans and their princes were allof them in despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace- thenorth and the northwest- spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury ofthe main- in a moment the dark waves uprear their heads and scattertheir sea-wrack in all directions- even thus troubled were thehearts of the Achaeans.

　　The son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to acouncil man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made hastealso himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in theirassembly. Agamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataracton the side of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh hespoke to the Achaeans. "My friends," said he, "princes and councillorsOf the Argives, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me.Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city ofTroy before returning, but he has played me false, and is nowbidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people.Such is the will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dustas he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore,let us all do as I say and sail back to our own country, for weshall not take Troy."

　　Thus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while satsorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last Diomed ofthe loud battle-cry made answer saying, "Son of Atreus, I will chideyour folly, as is my right in council. Be not then aggrieved that Ishould do so. In the first place you attacked me before all theDanaans and said that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives youngand old know that you did so. But the son of scheming Saturn endowedyou by halves only. He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, butvalour, which is the highest both right and might he did not give you.Sir, think you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlikeand cowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon goinghome- go- the way is open to you; the many ships that followed youfrom Mycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stayhere till we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should turnhomeward with their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still fight ontill we reach the goal of Ilius, for for heaven was with us when wecame."

　　The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed,and presently Nestor rose to speak. "Son of Tydeus," said he, "inwar your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel allwho are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light ofwhat you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end ofthe whole matter. You are still young- you might be the youngest of myown children- still you have spoken wisely and have counselled thechief of the Achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless I amolder than you and I will tell you every" thing; therefore let no man,not even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that fomentscivil discord is a clanless, hearthless outlaw.

　　"Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers,but let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that iswithout the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men;when they have been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give yourorders, for you are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast foryour councillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so;there is abundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of theAchaeans bring from Thrace daily. You have everything at your disposalwherewith to entertain guests, and you have many subjects. When manyare got together, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest-and sorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe haslit his watchfires hard by our ships. Who can be other thandismayed? This night will either be the ruin of our host, or save it."

　　Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinelswent out in their armour under command of Nestor's son Thrasymedes,a captain of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus andIalmenus: there were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the sonof Creion, noble Lycomedes. There were seven captains of thesentinels, and with each there went a hundred youths armed with longspears: they took their places midway between the trench and the wall,and when they had done so they lit their fires and got every man hissupper.

　　The son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans tohis quarters prepared a great feast in their honour. They laid theirhands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as theyhad enough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose counsel was evertruest, was the first to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, withall sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus.

　　"With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,will I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over muchpeople. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and touphold righteousness, that you may take thought for your peopleunder you; therefore it behooves you above all others both to speakand to give ear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have beenminded to speak wisely. All turns on you and on your commands,therefore I will say what I think will be best. No man will be of atruer mind than that which has been mine from the hour when you,sir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent againstmy judgment. I urged you not to do so, but you yielded to your ownpride, and dishonoured a hero whom heaven itself had honoured- for youstill hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however, letus think how we may appease him, both with presents and fairspeeches that may conciliate him."

　　And King Agamemnon answered, "Sir, you have reproved my follyjustly. I was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in himselfa host, and Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroyingmuch people of the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded tomy worser mind; therefore I will make amends, and will give himgreat gifts by way of atonement. I will tell them in the presence ofyou all. I will give him seven tripods that have never yet been on thefire, and ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldronsand twelve strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes.Rich, indeed, both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes asmy horses have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen,Lesbians, whom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos- all ofsurpassing beauty. I will give him these, and with them her whom Ierewhile took from him, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a greatoath that I never went up into her couch, nor have been with her afterthe manner of men and women.

　　"All these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter thegods vouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when weAchaeans are dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold andbronze to his liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan women,the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach AchaeanArgos, wealthiest of all lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I willshow him like honour with my own dear son Orestes, who is beingnurtured in all abundance. I have three daughters, Chrysothemis,Laodice, and lphianassa, let him take the one of his choice, freelyand without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; I will add suchdower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will givehim seven well established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire, wherethere is grass; holy Pherae and the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepeaalso, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, and onthe borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich incattle and sheep; they will honour him with gifts as though he werea god, and be obedient to his comfortable ordinances. All this willI do if he will now forgo his anger. Let him then yieldit is onlyHades who is utterly ruthless and unyielding- and hence he is of allgods the one most hateful to mankind. Moreover I am older and moreroyal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey me."

　　Then Nestor answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,Agamemnon. The gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then sendchosen messengers, who may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleuswithout delay. Let those go whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear toJove, lead the way; let Ajax and Ulysses follow, and let the heraldsOdius and Eurybates go with them. Now bring water for our hands, andbid all keep silence while we pray to Jove the son of Saturn, if so bethat he may have mercy upon us."

　　Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servantspoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled themixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after givingevery man his drink-offering; then, when they had made theirofferings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys setout from the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, lookingfirst to one and then to another, but most especially at Ulysses,was instant with them that they should prevail with the noble son ofPeleus.

　　They went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayedearnestly to earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of theson of Aeacus might incline favourably towards them. When they reachedthe ships and tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on alyre, fair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver.It was part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the cityof Eetion, and he was now diverting himself with it and singing thefeats of heroes. He was alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite tohim and said nothing, waiting till he should cease singing. Ulyssesand Ajax now came in- Ulysses leading the way -and stood before him.Achilles sprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, andPatroclus, when he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greetedthem saying, "All hail and welcome- you must come upon some greatmatter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of theAchaeans."

　　With this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats coveredwith purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him, "Sonof Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water withthe wine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear friends,who are now under my roof."

　　Patroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-blockin front of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, theloin also of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held themeat while Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put themon spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn high. Whenthe flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on topof them, lifting them up and setting them upon the spit-racks; andhe sprinkled them with salt. When the meat was roasted, he set it onplatters, and handed bread round the table in fair baskets, whileAchilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took his seat facingUlysses against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclusoffer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire,and they laid their hands upon the good things that were beforethem. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made asign to Phoenix, and when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup withwine and pledged Achilles.

　　"Hail," said he, "Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer,neither in the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has beenplenty to eat and drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter.Sir, we are in the face of great disaster, and without your helpknow not whether we shall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans andtheir allies have camped hard by our ships and by the wall; theyhave lit watchfires throughout their host and deem that nothing cannow prevent them from falling on our fleet. Jove, moreover, has senthis lightnings on their right; Hector, in all his glory, rages likea maniac; confident that Jove is with him he fears neither god norman, but is gone raving mad, and prays for the approach of day. Hevows that he will hew the high sterns of our ships in pieces, set fireto their hulls, and make havoc of the Achaeans while they are dazedand smothered in smoke; I much fear that heaven will make good hisboasting, and it will prove our lot to perish at Troy far from ourhome in Argos. Up, then, and late though it be, save the sons of theAchaeans who faint before the fury of the Trojans. You will repentbitterly hereafter if you do not, for when the harm is done there willbe no curing it; consider ere it be too late, and save the Danaansfrom destruction.

　　"My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia toAgamemnon, did he not charge you saying, 'Son, Minerva and Juno willmake you strong if they choose, but check your high temper, for thebetter part is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and theAchaeans old and young will respect you more for doing so.' These werehis words, but you have forgotten them. Even now, however, beappeased, and put away your anger from you. Agamemnon will make yougreat amends if you will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you whathe has said in his tent that he will give you. He will give youseven tripods that have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents ofgold; twenty iron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have wonraces and carried off prizes. Rich indeed both in land and gold ishe who has as many prizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon.Moreover he will give you seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom hechose for himself, when you took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty.He will give you these, and with them her whom he erewhile took fromyou, the daughter of Briseus, and he will swear a great oath, he hasnever gone up into her couch nor been with her after the manner of menand women. All these things will he give you now down, and ifhereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you cancome when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load your shipwith gold and bronze to your liking. You can take twenty Trojan women,the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach AchaeanArgos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his son-in-law, and hewill show you like honour with his own dear son Orestes, who isbeing nurtured in all abundance. Agamemnon has three daughters,Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa; you may take the one of yourchoice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; hewill add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter,and will give you seven well-established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, andHire where there is grass; holy Pheras and the rich meadows of Anthea;Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, andon the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich incattle and sheep; they will honour you with gifts as though were agod, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. All this willhe do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though you hate bothhim and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the rest of theAchaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they will honouryou as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands. Youmight even kill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he isinfatuated, and declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have broughtcan hold his own against him."

　　Achilles answered, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give youformal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be nomore of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do Ihate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hidesanother in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will beappeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of theDanaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my fighting. Hethat fights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero areheld in equal honour, and death deals like measure to him who worksand him who is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships- with mylife ever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes itto her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so man a long nighthave I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by dayagainst those who were fighting for their women. With my ships Ihave taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormedwith my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one ofthem, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where hewas by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and keptmuch himself.

　　"Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among thechieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone ofthe Achaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted- let him keepher and sleep with her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight theTrojans? What made the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them?Was it not for the sake of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the onlymen in the world who love their wives? Any man of common right feelingwill love and cherish her who is his own, as I this woman, with mywhole heart, though she was but a fruitling of my spear. Agamemnon hastaken her from me; he has played me false; I know him; let him temptme no further, for he shall not move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses,and to the other princes to save his ships from burning. He has donemuch without me already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deepand wide all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; buteven so he stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as Ifought the Achaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far fromthe city walls; he would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak tree,but no further. Once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escapemy onset: now, however, since I am in no mood to fight him, I willto-morrow offer sacrifice to Jove and to all the gods; I will drawmy ships into the water and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning,if you care to look, you will see my ships on the Hellespont, and mymen rowing out to sea with might and main. If great Neptune vouchsafesme a fair passage, in three days I shall be in Phthia. I have muchthere that I left behind me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shallbring back still further store of gold, of red copper, of fairwomen, and of iron, my share of the spoils that we have taken; but oneprize, he who gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I nowbid you, and tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him andbeware of him should he think that he can yet dupe others for hiseffrontery never fails him.

　　"As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. Iwill take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in commonwith him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozenme further; let him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of hisreason. I loathe his presents, and for himself care not one straw.He may offer me ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay-not though it be all that he has in the world, both now or evershall have; he may promise me the wealth of Orchomenus or ofEgyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world, forit has a hundred gates through each of which two hundred men may driveat once with their chariots and horses; he may offer me gifts as thesands of the sea or the dust of the plain in multitude, but even so heshall not move me till I have been revenged in full for the bitterwrong he has done me. I will not marry his daughter; she may be fairas Venus, and skilful as Minerva, but I will have none of her: letanother take her, who may be a good match for her and who rules alarger kingdom. If the gods spare me to return home, Peleus willfind me a wife; there are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia,daughters of kings that have cities under them; of these I can takewhom I will and marry her. Many a time was I minded when at home inPhthia to woo and wed a woman who would make me a suitable wife, andto enjoy the riches of my old father Peleus. My life is more to methan all the wealth of Ilius while it was yet at peace before theAchaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies on the stonefloor of Apollo's temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and sheepare to be had for harrying, and a man buy both tripods and horses ifhe wants them, but when his life has once left him it can neither bebought nor harried back again.

　　"My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I maymeet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive but myname will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die, but itwill be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of you, then, I say,'Go home, for you will not take Ilius.' Jove has held his hand overher to protect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore, asin duty bound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans the message that Ihave sent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving oftheir ships and people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the onethat they have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let himsleep here that he may sail with me in the morning if he so will.But I will not take him by force."

　　They all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which hehad denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his greatfear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said,"Noble Achilles, if you are now minded to return, and in thefierceness of your anger will do nothing to save the ships fromburning, how, my son, can I remain here without you? Your fatherPeleus bade me go with you when he sent you as a mere lad fromPhthia to Agamemnon. You knew nothing neither of war nor of the artswhereby men make their mark in council, and he sent me with you totrain you in all excellence of speech and action. Therefore, my son, Iwill not stay here without you- no, not though heaven itself vouchsafeto strip my years from off me, and make me young as I was when I firstleft Hellas the land of fair women. I was then flying the anger offather Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who was furious with me in thematter of his concubine, of whom he was enamoured to the wronging ofhis wife my mother. My mother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing tolie with the woman myself, that so she hate my father, and in thecourse of time I yielded. But my father soon came to know, andcursed me bitterly, calling the dread Erinyes to witness. He prayedthat no son of mine might ever sit upon knees- and the gods, Jove ofthe world below and awful Proserpine, fulfilled his curse. I tookcounsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me thinkon men's evil tongues and how I should be branded as the murderer ofmy father: nevertheless I could not bear to stay in my father'shouse with him so bitter a against me. My cousins and clansmen cameabout me, and pressed me sorely to remain; many a sheep and many an oxdid they slaughter, and many a fat hog did they set down to roastbefore the fire; many a jar, too, did they broach of my father's wine.Nine whole nights did they set a guard over me taking it in turns towatch, and they kept a fire always burning, both in the cloister ofthe outer court and in the inner court at the doors of the roomwherein I lay; but when the darkness of the tenth night came, Ibroke through the closed doors of my room, and climbed the wall of theouter court after passing quickly and unperceived through the men onguard and the women servants. I then fled through Hellas till I cameto fertile Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King Peleus, who made mewelcome and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heirto all his wealth. He made me rich and set me over much people,establishing me on the borders of Phthia where I was chief rulerover the Dolopians.

　　"It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with allmy heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had goneout elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up thedainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to yourlips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessnessover my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heavenhad vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and I made a son of you,Achilles, that in my hour of need you might protect me. Now,therefore, I say battle with your pride and beat it; cherish notyour anger for ever; the might and majesty of heaven are more thanours, but even heaven may be appeased; and if a man has sinned heprays the gods, and reconciles them to himself by his piteous criesand by frankincense, with drink-offerings and the savour of burntsacrifice. For prayers are as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled,with eyes askance, they follow in the footsteps of sin, who, beingfierce and fleet of foot, leaves them far behind him, and ever banefulto mankind outstrips them even to the ends of the world; butnevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healing after. If a man haspity upon these daughters of Jove when they draw near him, they willbless him and hear him too when he is praying; but if he deny them andwill not listen to them, they go to Jove the son of Saturn and praythat he may presently fall into sin- to his ruing bitterlyhereafter. Therefore, Achilles, give these daughters of Jove duereverence, and bow before them as all good men will bow. Were notthe son of Atreus offering you gifts and promising others later- if hewere still furious and implacable- I am not he that would bid youthrow off your anger and help the Achaeans, no matter how greattheir need; but he is giving much now, and more hereafter; he has senthis captains to urge his suit, and has chosen those who of all theArgives are most acceptable to you; make not then their words andtheir coming to be of none effect. Your anger has been righteous sofar. We have heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when theywere roused to fury, but still they could be won by gifts, and fairwords could soothe them.

　　"I have an old story in my mind- a very old one- but you are allfriends and I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians werefighting and killing one another round Calydon- the Aetoliansdefending the city and the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Dianaof the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because Oeneus hadnot offered her his harvest first-fruits. The other gods had allbeen feasted with hecatombs, but to the daughter of great Jove alonehe had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten her, or somehow or other ithad escaped him, and this was a grievous sin. Thereon the archergoddess in her displeasure sent a prodigious creature against him- asavage wild boar with great white tusks that did much harm to hisorchard lands, uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing themto the ground. But Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds frommany cities and killed it- for it was so monstrous that not a few wereneeded, and many a man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On thisthe goddess set the Curetes and the Aetolians fighting furiously aboutthe head and skin of the boar.

　　"So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with theCuretes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their groundunder the city walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angeredas even a wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed with hismother Althaea, and therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fairCleopatra, who was daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and ofIdes the man then living. He it was who took his bow and faced KingApollo himself for fair Marpessa's sake; her father and mother thennamed her Alcyone, because her mother had mourned with the plaintivestrains of the halcyon-bird when Phoebus Apollo had carried her off.Meleager, then, stayed at home with Cleopatra, nursing the anger whichhe felt by reason of his mother's curses. His mother, grieving for thedeath of her brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with herhands, calling upon Hades and on awful Proserpine; she went downupon her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed thatthey would kill her son- and Erinys that walks in darkness and knowsno ruth heard her from Erebus.

　　"Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, andthe dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon theelders of the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest oftheir priests, and begged him to come out and help them, promising hima great reward. They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the mostfertile in the plain of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the otheropen plough-land. The old warrior Oeneus implored him, standing at thethreshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. Hissisters and his mother herself besought him sore, but he the morerefused them; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest tohim also prayed him, but they could not move him till the foe wasbattering at the very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaledthe walls and were setting fire to the city. Then at last hissorrowing wife detailed the horrors that befall those whose city istaken; she reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is givenover to the flames, while the women and children are carried intocaptivity; when he heard all this, his heart was touched, and hedonned his armour to go forth. Thus of his own inward motion hesaved the city of the Aetolians; but they now gave him nothing ofthose rich rewards that they had offered earlier, and though hesaved the city he took nothing by it. Be not then, my son, thusminded; let not heaven lure you into any such course. When the shipsare burning it will be a harder matter to save them. Take the gifts,and go, for the Achaeans will then honour you as a god; whereas if youfight without taking them, you may beat the battle back, but youwill not be held in like honour."

　　And Achilles answered, "Phoenix, old friend and father, I have noneed of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will abidewith me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs arestrong. I say further- and lay my saying to your heart- vex me no morewith this weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son ofAtreus. Love him so well, and you may lose the love I bear you. Youought to help me rather in troubling those that trouble me; be king asmuch as I am, and share like honour with myself; the others shall takemy answer; stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed; atdaybreak we will consider whether to remain or go."

　　On this she nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was toprepare a bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take theirleave. Ajax son of Telamon then said, "Ulysses, noble son ofLaertes, let us be gone, for I see that our journey is vain. We mustnow take our answer, unwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who arewaiting to receive it. Achilles is savage and remorseless; he iscruel, and cares nothing for the love his comrades lavished upon himmore than on all the others. He is implacable- and yet if a man'sbrother or son has been slain he will accept a fine by way of amendsfrom him that killed him, and the wrong-doer having paid in fullremains in peace among his own people; but as for you, Achilles, thegods have put a wicked unforgiving spirit in your heart, and this, allabout one single girl, whereas we now offer you the seven best wehave, and much else into the bargain. Be then of a more gracious mind,respect the hospitality of your own roof. We are with you asmessengers from the host of the Danaans, and would fain he heldnearest and dearest to yourself of all the Achaeans."

　　"Ajax," replied Achilles, "noble son of Telamon, you have spokenmuch to my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, andremember how the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though Iwere some vile tramp, and that too in the presence of the Argives. Go,then, and deliver your message; say that I will have no concern withfighting till Hector, son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of theMyrmidons in his murderous course, and flings fire upon their ships.For all his lust of battle, I take it he will be held in check when heis at my own tent and ship."

　　On this they took every man his double cup, made theirdrink-offerings, and went back to the ships, Ulysses leading theway. But Patroclus told his men and the maid-servants to make readya comfortable bed for Phoenix; they therefore did so withsheepskins, a rug, and a sheet of fine linen. The old man then laidhimself down and waited till morning came. But Achilles slept in aninner room, and beside him the daughter of Phorbas lovely Diomede,whom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroclus lay on the other sideof the room, and with him fair Iphis whom Achilles had given himwhen he took Scyros the city of Enyeus.

　　When the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeansrose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. KingAgamemnon was the first to do so. Tell me, Ulysses," said he, "will hesave the ships from burning, or did be refuse, and is he stillfurious?"

　　Ulysses answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,Achilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever, andspurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with theAchaeans to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself,he said that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water. Hesaid further that he should advise every one to sail home likewise,for that you will not reach the goal of Ilius. 'Jove,' he said, 'haslaid his hand over the city to protect it, and the people have takenheart.' This is what he said, and the others who were with me can tellyou the same story- Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, whomay be trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep,for so Achilles would have it, that he might go home with him in themorning if he so would; but he will not take him by force."

　　They all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent anddejected, by reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refusedthem, till presently Diomed said, "Most noble son of Atreus, king ofmen, Agamemnon, you ought not to have sued the son of Peleus noroffered him gifts. He is proud enough as it is, and you haveencouraged him in his pride am further. Let him stay or go as he will.He will fight later when he is in the humour, and heaven puts it inhis mind to do so. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; we haveeaten and drunk our fill, let us then take our rest, for in rest thereis both strength and stay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears,forthwith bring out your host and your horsemen in front of the ships,urging them on, and yourself fighting among the foremost."

　　Thus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. Theythen made their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent,where they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.

　　BOOK X

　　NOW the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the wholenight through, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that hecould get no rest. As when fair Juno's lord flashes his lightning intoken of great rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten theground, or again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungrywar, even so did Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soultrembled within him. When he looked upon the plain of Troy hemarvelled at the many watchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at thesound of pipes and flutes and of the hum of men, but when presently heturned towards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hairby handfuls before Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the verydisquietness of his soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at onceto Nestor son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find anyway of the Achaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on hisshirt, bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of ahuge tawny lion over his shoulders- a skin that reached his feet-and took his spear in his hand.

　　Neither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argiveswho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight theTrojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther,put a casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawnyhand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the mostpowerful of the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as thoughhe were a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already puttinghis goodly array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that hisbrother had come.

　　Menelaus spoke first. "Why," said he, "my dear brother, are you thusarming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit theTrojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, andspy upon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed ofgreat daring."

　　And King Agamemnon answered, "Menelaus, we both of us need shrewdcounsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed hismind, and inclines towards Hector's sacrifices rather than ours. Inever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in oneday as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans- andthat too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god norgoddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, withall speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.Meanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among thecompanies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; theywill listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, andMeriones brother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. Itwas to them more particularly that we gave this charge."

　　Menelaus replied, "How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay withthem and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I havegiven your orders?" "Wait," answered King Agamemnon, "for there are somany paths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call everyman on your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineageand by his father's name, give each all titular observance, andstand not too much upon your own dignity; we must take our fullshare of toil, for at our birth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us."

　　With these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and wenton to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tenthard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him- his shield,his two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdlewith which the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his peopleinto battle- for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on hiselbow and looked up at Agamemnon. "Who is it," said he, "that goesthus about the host and the ships alone and in the dead of night, whenmen are sleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for somecomrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but speak. What is yourbusiness?"

　　And Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to theAchaean name, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove haslaid labour and sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and mylimbs carry me. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon myeyelids, but my heart is big with war and with the jeopardy of theAchaeans. I am in great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and withoutsure counsel; my heart beats as though it would leap out of my body,and my limbs fail me. If then you can do anything- for you toocannot sleep- let us go the round of the watch, and see whether theyare drowsy with toil and sleeping to the neglect of their duty. Theenemy is encamped hard and we know not but he may attack us by night."

　　Nestor replied, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,Jove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he willhave troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. Iwill go with you, and we will rouse others, either the son ofTydeus, or Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Someone had also better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for theirships are not near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot howeverrefrain from blaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him- andI will say so plainly, even at the risk of offending you- for sleepingand leaving all this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going aboutimploring aid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are inextreme danger."

　　And Agamemnon answered, "Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly,for he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself- not indeed fromsloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects meto take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before Iwas, and came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to callthe very men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shallfind them with the watch outside the gates, for it was there I saidthat we would meet them."

　　"In that case," answered Nestor, "the Argives will not blame him nordisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives theminstructions."

　　With this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about hiscomely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large,and of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shodspear, and wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. Firsthe called loudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him,for he was soon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outsidehis tent and said, "Why do you go thus alone about the host, and alongthe line of the ships in the stillness of the night? What is it thatyou find so urgent?" And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, "Ulysses,noble son of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in greatstraits. Come with me and let us wake some other, who may advisewell with us whether we shall fight or fly."

　　On this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about hisshoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son ofTydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with hiscomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as fortheir spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts thatwere driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afarlike the lightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon the skinof an ox, with a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor went upto him and stirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding himand urging him to bestir himself. "Wake up," he exclaimed, "son ofTydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? Can you not see that theTrojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships,with but a little space between us and them?"

　　On these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, "Old man, yourheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are thereno younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse theprinces? There is no tiring you."

　　And Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, "My son, all that youhave said is true. I have good sons, and also much people who mightcall the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger;life and death are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Gothen, for you are younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajaxand the fleet son of Phyleus."

　　Diomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders- askin that reached his feet- and grasped his spear. When he hadroused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went theround of those who were on guard, and found the captains notsleeping at their posts but wakeful and sitting with their armsabout them. As sheep dogs that watch their flocks when they areyarded, and hear a wild beast coming through the mountain foresttowards them- forthwith there is a hue and cry of dogs and men, andslumber is broken- even so was sleep chased from the eyes of theAchaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for they turnedconstantly towards the plain whenever they heard any stir among theTrojans. The old man was glad bade them be of good cheer. "Watch on,my children," said he, "and let not sleep get hold upon you, lestour enemies triumph over us."

　　With this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of theAchaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the braveson of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they werebeyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held theirmeeting on the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses,for it was here that when night fell Hector had turned back from hisonslaught on the Argives. They sat down, therefore, and held debatewith one another.

　　Nestor spoke first. "My friends," said he, "is there any man boldenough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or usnews of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by theships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted theAchaeans, they will retire within their walls. If he could learn allthis and come back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven inthe mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefsfrom all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with herlamb- which is a present of surpassing value- and he would be asked asa guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings."

　　They all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spokesaying, "Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans overagainst us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greaterconfidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of them may seesome opportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a manis alone he is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker."

　　On this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes,servants of Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, sodid Menelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the hostof the Trojans, for he was ever full of daring, and thereonAgamemnon king of men spoke thus: "Diomed," said he, "son of Tydeus,man after my own heart, choose your comrade for yourself- take thebest man of those that have offered, for many would now go with you.Do not through delicacy reject the better man, and take the worstout of respect for his lineage, because he is of more royal blood."

　　He said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, "Ifyou bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can Ifail to think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to faceall kinds of danger- and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he wereto go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he isquick to see and understand."

　　"Son of Tydeus," replied Ulysses, "say neither good nor ill aboutme, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, forthe night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,two-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone leftus."

　　They then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son ofTydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship)and on his head he set a helmet of bull's hide without either peakor crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear.Meriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he seta leathern helmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathernthongs, while on the outside it was thickly studded with boar's teeth,well and skilfully set into it; next the head there was an innerlining of felt. This helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out ofEleon when he broke into the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. Hegave it to Amphidamas of Cythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamasgave it as a guest-gift to Molus, who gave it to his son Meriones; andnow it was set upon the head of Ulysses.

　　When the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftainsbehind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upontheir right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but theyheard its cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed toMinerva: "Hear me," he cried, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you whospy out all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships;befriend me in this mine hour, and grant that we may return to theships covered with glory after having achieved some mighty exploitthat shall bring sorrow to the Trojans."

　　Then Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: "Hear me too," said he,"daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with mynoble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by theAchaeans. He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus,and went to the city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; onhis return thence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds ofdaring, for you were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard menow, and in return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heiferof a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under theyoke. I will gild her horns and will offer her up to you insacrifice."

　　Thus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When theyhad done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their waylike two lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stainedbodies of them that had fallen.

　　Neither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too calledthe princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set hiscounsel before them. "Is there one," said he, "who for a greatreward will do me the service of which I will tell you? He shall bewell paid if he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple ofhorses, the fleetest that can be found at the ships of the Achaeans,if he will dare this thing; and he will win infinite honour to boot;he must go to the ships and find out whether they are still guarded asheretofore, or whether now that we have beaten them the Achaeansdesign to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keeptheir watches."

　　They all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certainman named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald- a man rich in goldand bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an onlyson among five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans."I, Hector," said he, "Will to the ships and will exploit them. Butfirst hold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me thechariot, bedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry thenoble son of Peleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not failyou. I will go through the host from one end to the other till Icome to the ship of Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of theAchaeans are now consulting whether they shall fight or fly."

　　When he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and sworehim his oath saying, "May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bearwitness that no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds,and that you shall have your will with them for ever."

　　The oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen ongoing. He hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he worethe skin of a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferretskin. Then he took a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships,but he was not to return with any news for Hector. When he had leftthe horses and the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way,but Ulysses perceived his coming and said to Diomed, "Diomed, hereis some one from the camp; I am not sure whether he is a spy, orwhether it is some thief who would plunder the bodies of the dead; lethim get a little past us, we can then spring upon him and take him.If, however, he is too quick for us, go after him with your spearand hem him in towards the ships away from the Trojan camp, to preventhis getting back to the town."

　　With this they turned out of their way and lay down among thecorpses. Dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he hadgot about as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceedsone that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow landquicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard theirfootsteps he stood still, for he made sure they were friends fromthe Trojan camp come by Hector's orders to bid him return; when,however, they were only a spear's cast, or less away form him, hesaw that they were enemies as fast as his legs could take him. Theothers gave chase at once, and as a couple of well-trained houndspress forward after a doe or hare that runs screaming in front ofthem, even so did the son of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cuthim off from his own people. But when he had fled so far towards theships that he would soon have fallen in with the outposts, Minervainfused fresh strength into the son of Tydeus for fear some other ofthe Achaeans might have the glory of being first to hit him, and hemight himself be only second; he therefore sprang forward with hisspear and said, "Stand, or I shall throw my spear, and in that caseI shall soon make an end of you."

　　He threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flewover the man's right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. Hestood stock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered,and he turned pale with fear. The two came breathless up to him andseized his hands, whereon he began to weep and said, "Take me alive; Iwill ransom myself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wroughtiron, and from this my father will satisfy you with a very largeransom, should he hear of my being alive at the ships of theAchaeans."

　　"Fear not," replied Ulysses, "let no thought of death be in yourmind; but tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going aboutalone in the dead of night away from your camp and towards theships, while other men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies ofthe slain, or did Hector send you to spy out what was going on atthe ships? Or did you come here of your own mere notion?"

　　Dolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: "Hector, with hisvain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He saidhe would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and hisbronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of theflying night, get close to the enemy, and find out whether the shipsare still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now that we have beatenthem, the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion areneglecting to keep their watches."

　　Ulysses smiled at him and answered, "You had indeed set your heartupon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus arehardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man thanAchilles himself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, andtell me true, where did you leave Hector when you started? Wherelies his armour and his horses? How, too, are the watches andsleeping-ground of the Trojans ordered? What are their plans? Willthey stay here by the ships and away from the city, or now that theyhave worsted the Achaeans, will they retire within their walls?"

　　And Dolon answered, "I will tell you truly all. Hector and the othercouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of greatIlus, away from the general tumult; as for the guards about whichyou ask me, there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host.The Trojans have their watchfires, for they are bound to have them;they, therefore, are awake and keep each other to their duty assentinels; but the allies who have come from other places are asleepand leave it to the Trojans to keep guard, for their wives andchildren are not here."

　　Ulysses then said, "Now tell me; are they sleeping among theTrojan troops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I mayunderstand it."

　　"I will tell you truly all," replied Dolon. "To the seaward liethe Carians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and thenoble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians andMeonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why askabout an this? If you want to find your way into the host of theTrojans, there are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lieapart from the others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesusson of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongestthat I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter thanany wind that blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold,and he has brought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarestworkmanship- too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet onlyfor the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securelyhere, until you come back and have proved my words whether they befalse or true."

　　Diomed looked sternly at him and answered, "Think not, Dolon, forall the good information you have given us, that you shall escapenow you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you willcome some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spyor as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you willgive no more trouble."

　　On this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech himfurther, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with hissword and cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in thedust while he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from hishead, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysseshung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, andprayed saying, "Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you inpreference to all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us stillfurther towards the horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians."

　　With these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisktree, and they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gatheringboughs of tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came backthrough the' flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwardsamid the fallen armour and the blood, and came presently to thecompany of Thracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out withtheir day's toil; their goodly armour was lying on the ground besidethem all orderly in three rows, and each man had his yoke of horsesbeside him. Rhesus was sleeping in the middle, and hard by him hishorses were made fast to the topmost rim of his chariot. Ulyssesfrom some way off saw him and said, "This, Diomed, is the man, andthese are the horses about which Dolon whom we killed told us. Do yourvery utmost; dally not about your armour, but loose the horses atonce- or else kill the men yourself, while I see to the horses."

　　Thereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smotethem right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were beinghacked about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lionsprings furiously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds withouttheir shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thraciansoldiers till he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came anddrew them aside by their feet one by one, that the horses might goforward freely without being frightened as they passed over the deadbodies, for they were not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeuscame to the king, he killed him too (which made thirteen), as he wasbreathing hard, for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, theseed of Oeneus, hovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Ulyssesuntied the horses, made them fast one to another and drove them off,striking them with his bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip fromthe chariot. Then he whistled as a sign to Diomed.

　　But Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed hemight accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in whichthe king's armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to liftthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should notkill some more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came upto him and said, "Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may bedriven thither, should some other god rouse the Trojans."

　　Diomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon thehorses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to theships of the Achaeans.

　　But Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the sonof Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of theTrojans he roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noblekinsman of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that thehorses were no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping intheir death-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon hisfriend by name. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as thepeople kept hurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds ofthe heroes who had now got away towards the ships.

　　When they reached the place where they had killed Hector's scout,Ulysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to theground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses andremounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forwardnothing loth towards the ships as though of their own free will.Nestor was first to hear the tramp of their feet. "My friends," saidhe, "princes and counsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right orwrong?- but I must say what I think: there is a sound in my ears as ofthe tramp of horses. I hope it may Diomed and Ulysses driving inhorses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the bravest of theArgives may have come to some harm at their hands."

　　He had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,whereon the others shook hands right gladly with them andcongratulated them. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to questionthem. "Tell me," said he, "renowned Ulysses, how did you two come bythese horses? Did you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did somegod meet you and give them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am wellconversant with the Trojans, for old warrior though I am I neverhold back by the ships, but I never yet saw or heard of such horses asthese are. Surely some god must have met you and given them to you,for you are both of dear to Jove, and to Jove's daughter Minerva."

　　And Ulysses answered, "Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaeanname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses thanthese, for the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses,however, about which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace.Diomed killed their king with the twelve bravest of his companions.Hard by the ships we took a thirteenth man- a scout whom Hector andthe other Trojans had sent as a spy upon our ships."

　　He laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, whilethe other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the stronglybuilt quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses withthongs of leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stoodeating their sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoilsof Dolon at the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacredoffering to Minerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea andwashed the sweat from their bodies, and from their necks and thighs.When the sea-water had taken all the sweat from off them, and hadrefreshed them, they went into the baths and washed themselves.After they had so done and had anointed themselves with oil, theysat down to table, and drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made adrink-offering of wine to Minerva.

　　BOOK XI

　　AND now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger oflight alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord withthe ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. Shetook her stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses' ship which wasmiddlemost of all, so that her voice might carry farthest on eitherside, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and onthe other towards those of Achilles- for these two heroes,well-assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn up theirships at the two ends of the line. There she took her stand, andraised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the Achaeans withcourage, giving them heart to fight resolutely and with all theirmight, so that they had rather stay there and do battle than go homein their ships.

　　The son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselvesfor battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodlygreaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle clasps ofsilver; and about his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras hadonce given him as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far asCyprus that the Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore hegave it to the king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve ofgold, and ten of tin. There were serpents of cyanus that rearedthemselves up towards the neck, three upon either side, like therainbows which the son of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortalmen. About his shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses ofgold; and the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith tohang it. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered hisbody when he was in battle- fair to see, with ten circles of bronzerunning all round see, wit it. On the body of the shield there weretwenty bosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the middle:this last was made to show a Gorgon's head, fierce and grim, with Routand Panic on either side. The band for the arm to go through was ofsilver, on which there was a writhing snake of cyanus with three headsthat sprang from a single neck, and went in and out among one another.On his head Agamemnon set a helmet, with a peak before and behind, andfour plumes of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; then hegrasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of hisarmour shot from him as a flame into the firmament, while Juno andMinerva thundered in honour of the king of rich Mycene.

　　Every man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to holdthem in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on footclad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into thedawning. The chiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses gotthere, but these came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portentof evil sound about their host, and the dew fell red with blood, forhe was about to send many a brave man hurrying down to Hades.

　　The Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain,were gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who washonoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons ofAntenor, Polybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god.Hector's round shield showed in the front rank, and as some banefulstar that shines for a moment through a rent in the clouds and isagain hidden beneath them; even so was Hector now seen in the frontranks and now again in the hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamedlike the lightning of aegis-bearing Jove.

　　And now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon arich man's land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so didthe Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no moodfor yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the betterof the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was theonly god that went among them; the others were not there, but stayedquietly each in his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus.All of them blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to Live victory tothe Trojans, but father Jove heeded them not: he held aloof fromall, and sat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down uponthe city of the Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam ofbronze, and alike upon the slayers and on the slain.

　　Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their dartsrained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hourdrew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will gethis midday meal- for he has felled till his hands are weary; he istired out, and must now have food- then the Danaans with a cry thatrang through all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy.Agamemnon led them on, and slew first Bienor, a leader of hispeople, and afterwards his comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprangfrom his chariot and was coming full towards him; but Agamemnon struckhim on the forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no availagainst the weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that hisbrains were battered in and he was killed in full fight.

　　Agamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them withtheir breasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went onto kill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, theother born in wedlock; they were in the same chariot- the bastarddriving, while noble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had oncetaken both of them prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had boundthem with fresh withes as they were shepherding, but he had taken aransom for them; now, however, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus inthe chest above the nipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphushard by the ear and threw him from his chariot. Forthwith hestripped their goodly armour from off them and recognized them, for hehad already seen them at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida.As a lion fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his greatjaws, robbing them of their tender life while he on his way back tohis lair- the hind can do nothing for them even though she be closeby, for she is in an agony of fear, and flies through the thickforest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before the mighty monster-so, no man of the Trojans could help Isus and Antiphus, for theywere themselves flying panic before the Argives.

　　Then King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander andbrave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost inpreventing Helen's being restored to Menelaus, for he was largelybribed by Alexandrus; and now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in thesame chariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand- for they hadlost hold of the reins and the horses were mad with fear. The son ofAtreus sprang upon them like a lion, and the pair besought him fromtheir chariot. "Take us alive," they cried, "son of Atreus, and youshall receive a great ransom for us. Our father Antimachus has greatstore of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this he will satisfyyou with a very large ransom should he hear of our being alive atthe ships of the Achaeans."

　　With such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, butthey heard no pitiful answer in return. "If," said Agamemnon, "you aresons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed thatMenelaus and Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should bekilled and not suffered to return, you shall now pay for the fouliniquity of your father."

　　As he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth,smiting him on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermostupon the ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; hecut off his hands and his head- which he sent rolling in among thecrowd as though it were a ball. There he let them both lie, andwherever the ranks were thickest thither he flew, while the otherAchaeans followed. Foot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe inrout before them, and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen,and the thundering tramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust frim offthe plain. King Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them andcheering on the Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze-the eddying gusts whirl fire in all directions till the thicketsshrivel and are consumed before the blast of the flame- even so fellthe heads of the flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, andmany a noble pair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highwaysof war, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more usefulnow to vultures than to their wives.

　　Jove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnageand din of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling outlustily to the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son ofDardanus, in the middle of the plain, and past the place of the wildfig-tree making always for the city- the son of Atreus still shouting,and with hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached theScaean gates and the oak tree, there they halted and waited for theothers to come up. Meanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over themiddle of the plain like a herd cows maddened with fright when alion has attacked them in the dead of night- he springs on one ofthem, seizes her neck in the grip of his strong teeth and then laps upher blood and gorges himself upon her entrails- even so did KingAgamemnon son of Atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmostas they fled pell-mell before him. Many a man was flung headlongfrom his chariot by the hand of the son of Atreus, for he wieldedhis spear with fury.

　　But when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city,the father of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat,thunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He thentold Iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him. "Go," saidhe, "fleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector-  say that so long as hesees Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks,he is to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes tohis chariot, then will I vouchsafe him strength to slay till hereach the ships and night falls at the going down of the sun."

　　Iris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from thecrests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariotand horses. Then she said, "Hector son of Priam, peer of gods incounsel, father Jove has sent me to bear you this message- so longas you see Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojanranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt ofthe battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow,and takes to his chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength toslay till you reach the ships, and till night falls at the goingdown of the sun."

　　When she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armedfrom his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went abouteverywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, andstirring the dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round,and again met the Achaeans, while the Argives on their partstrengthened their battalions. The battle was now in array and theystood face to face with one another, Agamemnon ever pressing forwardin his eagerness to be ahead of all others.

　　Tell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who,whether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to faceAgamemnon? It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and ofgreat stature, who was brought up in fertile Thrace the mother ofsheep. Cisses, his mother's father, brought him up in his own housewhen he was a child- Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reachedmanhood, Cisses would have kept him there, and was for giving himhis daughter in marriage, but as soon as he had married he set outto fight the Achaeans with twelve ships that followed him: these hehad left at Percote and had come on by land to Ilius. He it was thatnaw met Agamemnon son of Atreus. When they were close up with oneanother, the son of Atreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him onthe girdle below the cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trustingto his strength of arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nornearly so, for the point of the spear struck against the silver andwas turned aside as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caughtit from his hand, and drew it towards him with the fury of a lion;he then drew his sword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on theneck. So there the poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were ofbronze, killed in the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from hiswedded wife, of whom he had had no joy though he had given much forher: he had given a hundred-head of cattle down, and had promisedlater on to give a thousand sheep and goats mixed, from thecountless flocks of which he was possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreusthen despoiled him, and carried off his armour into the host of theAchaeans.

　　When noble Coon, Antenor's eldest son, saw this, sore indeed werehis eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon hegot beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of hisarm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right through thearm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for thisdid he leave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear thatflew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon Coon who was trying to dragoff the body of his brother- his father's son- by the foot, and wascrying for help to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnonstruck him with a bronze-shod spear and killed him as he wasdragging the dead body through the press of men under cover of hisshield: he then cut off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas.Thus did the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the sonof Atreus, and go down into the house of Hades.

　　As long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon wentabout attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and withgreat handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and thewound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which theEilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno anddispensers of cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour-even so sharp were the pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to hischariot, and bade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was ingreat agony. With a loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, "Myfriends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, defend the shipsyourselves, for Jove has not suffered me to fight the whole daythrough against the Trojans."

　　With this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, andthey flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foamand their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out ofthe battle.

　　When Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to theTrojans and Lycians saying, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors,be men, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; theirbest man has left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph;charge the foe with your chariots that. you may win still greaterglory."

　　With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as ahuntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so didHector, peer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans.Full of hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fightlike some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes itsdeep blue waters into fury.

　　What, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killedin the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus,Autonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus;Aesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftainsof the Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank andfile. As when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white southand beats them down with the fierceness of its fury- the waves ofthe sea roll high, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of thewandering wind- even so thick were the heads of them that fell bythe hand of Hector.

　　All had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans wouldhave fled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out toDiomed, "Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forgetour prowess? Come, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, weshall be shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships."

　　And Diomed answered, "Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shallhave scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to theTrojans rather than to us."

　　With these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to theground, smiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysseskilled Molion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that theyhad stopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on playinghavoc with the foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend thehounds that hunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slaythem, and the Achaeans were thankful to have breathing time in theirflight from Hector.

　　They then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons ofMerops of Percote, who excelled all others in the arts ofdivination. He had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they wouldnot obey him, for fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son ofTydeus slew them both and stripped them of their armour, while Ulysseskilled Hippodamus and Hypeirochus.

　　And now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained thatneither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing oneanother. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in thehip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to flywith, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of itat some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremostuntil he lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed andUlysses were making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followedby the Trojan ranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, andsaid to Ulysses who was beside him, "Great Hector is bearing down uponus and we shall be undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset."

　　He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss hismark. He had aimed at Hector's head near the top of his helmet, butbronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spearwas stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal,which Phoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a greatbound under cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and proppedhimself with his brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness hadfallen on his eyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashedin among the foremost fighters, to the place where he had seen itstrike the ground; meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springingback into his chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means hesaved his life. But Diomed made at him with his spear and said,"Dog, you have again got away though death was close on your heels.Phoebus Apollo, to whom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, hasagain saved you, nevertheless I will meet you and make and end ofyou hereafter, if there is any god who will stand by me too and bemy helper. For the present I must pursue those I can lay hands on."

　　As he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, butAlexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaningagainst a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son ofDardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass fromoff the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the shieldfrom off his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly an arrowthat sped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat ofDiomed's right foot, going right through it and fixing itself in theground. Thereon Paris with a hearty laugh sprang forward from hishiding-place, and taunted him saying, "You are wounded- my arrow hasnot been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly andkilled you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion,would have had a truce from evil."

　　Diomed all undaunted answered, "Archer, you who without your bow arenothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in singlecombat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serveyou in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched thesole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy hadhit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wounda man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for myweapon will lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief andhis children will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening theearth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round him."

　　Thus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under thiscover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was thepain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot andbade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.

　　Ulysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for theywere all panic-stricken. "Alas," said he to himself in his dismay,"what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before theseodds, but it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner,for the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic.But why talk to myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowardsquit the field, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must standfirm and hold his own."

　　While he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advancedand hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to me it. As houndsand lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lairwhetting his white tusks- they attack him from every side and can hearthe gnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still holdtheir ground- even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses.First he sprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on theshoulder with a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. Afterthese he struck Chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he hadjust sprung down from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutchedthe earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went onto wound Charops son of Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus,hero that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he was close toUlysses he said, "Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil,this day you shall either boast of having killed both the sons ofHippasus and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall beforemy spear."

　　With these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear wentthrough the shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass,tearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not sufferit to pierce the entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hourwas not yet come, but he gave ground and said to Socus, "Wretch, youshall now surely die. You have stayed me from fighting further withthe Trojans, but you shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory tomyself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds."

　　Socus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck himin the back midway between the shoulders, and went right through hischest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over himsaying, "O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has beentoo quick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, noteven in death shall your father and mother close your eyes, but theravening vultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their darkwings and devour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans willgive me my due rites of burial."

　　So saying he drew Socus's heavy spear out of his flesh and fromhis shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn sothat he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses wasbleeding they raised a great shout and came on in a body towardshim; he therefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come andhelp him. Thrice did he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice didbrave Menelaus hear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was closebeside him and said, "Ajax, noble son of Telamon, captain of yourpeople, the cry of Ulysses rings in my ears, as though the Trojans hadcut him off and were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let usmake our way through the throng; it will be well that we defend him; Ifear he may come to harm for all his valour if he be left withoutsupport, and the Danaans would miss him sorely."

　　He led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans hadgathered round Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round thecarcase of some homed stag that has been hit with an arrow- the staghas fled at full speed so long as his blood was warm and hisstrength has lasted, but when the arrow has overcome him, the savagejackals devour him in the shady glades of the forest. Then heavensends a fierce lion thither, whereon the jackals fly in terror and thelion robs them of their prey- even so did Trojans many and bravegather round crafty Ulysses, but the hero stood at bay and kept themoff with his spear. Ajax then came up with his shield before himlike a wall, and stood hard by, whereon the Trojans fled in alldirections. Menelaus took Ulysses by the hand, and led him out ofthe press while his squire brought up his chariot, but Ajax rushedfuriously on the Trojans and killed Doryclus, a bastard son ofPriam; then he wounded Pandocus, Lysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes;as some swollen torrent comes rushing in full flood from the mountainson to the plain, big with the rain of heaven- many a dry oak andmany a pine does it engulf, and much mud does it bring down and castinto the sea- even so did brave Ajax chase the foe furiously overthe plain, slaying both men and horses.

　　Hector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fightingon the extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander,where the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestorand brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughterwith his spear and furious driving, and was destroying the ranksthat were opposed to him; still the Achaeans would have given noground, had not Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen stayed theprowess of Machaon shepherd of his people, by wounding him in theright shoulder with a triple-barbed arrow. The Achaeans were ingreat fear that as the fight had turned against them the Trojans mighttake him prisoner, and Idomeneus said to Nestor, "Nestor son ofNeleus, honour to the Achaean name, mount your chariot at once; takeMachaon with you and drive your horses to the ships as fast as youcan. A physician is worth more than several other men put together,for he can cut out arrows and spread healing herbs."

　　Nestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he atonce mounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physicianAesculapius went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onwardnothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own free will.

　　Then Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector fromhis place beside him, "Hector, here are we two fighting on the extremewing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout,they and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before him;I know him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot andhorses thither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately,and where the cry of battle is loudest."

　　With this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whipthey drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans,over the bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle wasbespattered with blood, and the rail round the car was covered withsplashes both from the horses' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels.Hector tore his way through and flung himself into the thick of thefight, and his presence threw the Danaans into confusion, for hisspear was not long idle; nevertheless though he went among the rankswith sword and spear, and throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax sonof Telamon, for Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought abetter man than himself.

　　Then father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heartof Ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind him-looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were somewild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowlybackwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from theirstockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pickof their herd- he makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for thedarts from many a strong hand fall thick around him, with burningbrands that scare him for all his fury, and when morning comes heslinks foiled and angry away- even so did Ajax, sorely against hiswill, retreat angrily before the Trojans, fearing for the ships of theAchaeans. Or as some lazy ass that has had many a cudgel brokenabout his back, when he into a field begins eating the corn- boys beathim but he is too many for them, and though they lay about withtheir sticks they cannot hurt him; still when he has had his fill theyat last drive him from the field- even so did the Trojans and theirallies pursue great Ajax, ever smiting the middle of his shield withtheir darts. Now and again he would turn and show fight, keepingback the battalions of the Trojans, and then he would again retreat;but he prevented any of them from making his way to the ships.Single-handed he stood midway between the Trojans and Achaeans: thespears that sped from their hands stuck some of them in his mightyshield, while many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the groundere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair flesh.

　　Now when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax wasbeing overpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him andhurled his spear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver belowthe midriff, and laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and strippedthe armour from his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimedan arrow at him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrowbroke, but the point that was left in the wound dragged on thethigh; he drew back, therefore, under cover of his comrades to savehis life, shouting as he did so to the Danaans, "My friends, princesand counsellors of the Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who isbeing overpowered, and I doubt whether he will come out of the fightalive. Hither, then, to the rescue of great Ajax son of Telamon."

　　Even so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others camenear, and gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from theirshoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, andturned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men.

　　Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile themares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor outof the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achillessaw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of his shipwatching the hard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from theship to his comrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and cameout looking like Mars himself- here indeed was the beginning of theill that presently befell him. "Why," said he, "Achilles do you callme? what do you what do you want with me?" And Achilles answered,"Noble son of Menoetius, man after my own heart, I take it that Ishall now have the Achaeans praying at my knees, for they are in greatstraits; go, Patroclus, and ask Nestor who is that he is bearingaway wounded from the field; from his back I should say it was Machaonson of Aesculapius, but I could not see his face for the horses wentby me at full speed."

　　Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set offrunning by the ships and tents of the Achaeans.

　　When Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son ofNeleus, they dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horsesfrom the chariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seasideto dry the sweat from their shirts, and when they had so done theycame inside and took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had hadawarded to him from Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them amess; she was daughter of wise Arsinous, and the Achaeans had givenher to Nestor because he excelled all of them in counsel. First sheset for them a fair and well-made table that had feet of cyanus; on itthere was a vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink,with honey and cakes of barley-meal. There was also a cup of rareworkmanship which the old man had brought with him from home,studded with bosses of gold; it had four handles, on each of whichthere were two golden doves feeding, and it had two feet to standon. Any one else would hardly have been able to lift it from the tablewhen it was full, but Nestor could do so quite easily. In this thewoman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; shegrated goat's milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in ahandful of white barley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess shebade them drink it. When they had done so and had thus quenchedtheir thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at this momentPatroclus appeared at the door.

　　When the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand,led him into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; butPatroclus stood where he was and said, "Noble sir, I may not stay, youcannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to betrifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you werebearing away from the field. I can now see for myself that he isMachaon shepherd of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles. You,sir, know what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even whereno blame should lie."

　　And Nestor answered, "Why should Achilles care to know how many ofthe Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns inour host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed sonof Tydeus is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus has beenhit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing this manfrom the field- he too wounded- with an arrow; neverthelessAchilles, so valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Willhe wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and weperish one upon the other? As for me, I have no strength nor stay inme any longer; would that I Were still young and strong as in the dayswhen there was a fight between us and the men of Elis about somecattle-raiding. I then killed Itymoneus the valiant son of Hypeirochusa dweller in Elis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dartthrown my hand while fighting in the front rank in defence of hiscows, so he fell and the country people around him were in great fear.We drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds ofcattle and as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, andas many wide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses moreover we seized ahundred and fifty, all of them mares, and many had foals runningwith them. All these did we drive by night to Pylus the city ofNeleus, taking them within the city; and the heart of Neleus wasglad in that I had taken so much, though it was the first time I hadever been in the field. At daybreak the heralds went round crying thatall in Elis to whom there was a debt owing should come; and theleading Pylians assembled to divide the spoils. There were many towhom the Epeans owed chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and hadbeen oppressed with wrong; in former years Hercules had come, andhad laid his hand heavy upon us, so that all our best men hadperished. Neleus had had twelve sons, but I alone was left; the othershad all been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all this had lookeddown upon us and had done us much evil. My father chose a herd ofcattle and a great flock of sheep- three hundred in all- and he tooktheir shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to him inElis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and their chariotswith them had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, but KingAugeas took them, and sent back their driver grieving for the lossof his horses. Neleus was angered by what he had both said and done,and took great value in return, but he divided the rest, that no manmight have less than his full share.

　　"Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the godsthroughout the city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in abody, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array, and withthem the two Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads andunused to fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perchedupon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border city Pylus; this theywould destroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they hadcrossed their whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympusand bade us set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiersin Pylos, for the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, andhid my horses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war;nevertheless Minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as Iwas, I fought among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost ofthem. There is a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene,and there they that were mounted (and I with them) waited tillmorning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force.Thence in full panoply and equipment we came towards noon to thesacred waters of the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almightyJove, with a bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer toMinerva. After this we took supper in our companies, and laid usdown to rest each in his armour by the river.

　　"The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to takeit, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store forthem. When the sun's rays began to fall upon the earth we joinedbattle, praying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight hadbegun, I was the first to kill my man and take his horses- to witthe warrior Mulius. He was son-in-law to Augeas, having married hiseldest daughter, golden-haired Agamede, who knew the virtues ofevery herb which grows upon the face of the earth. I speared him as hewas coming towards me, and when he fell headlong in the dust, I sprangupon his chariot and took my place in the front ranks. The Epeans fledin all directions when they saw the captain of their horsemen (thebest man they had) laid low, and I swept down on them like awhirlwind, taking fifty chariots- and in each of them two men bitthe dust, slain by my spear. I should have even killed the twoMoliones sons of Actor, unless their real father, Neptune lord ofthe earthquake, had hidden them in a thick mist and borne them outof the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the Pylians a great victory, forwe chased them far over the plain, killing the men and bringing intheir armour, till we had brought our horses to Buprasium rich inwheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that is called Alision,at which point Minerva turned the people back. There I slew the lastman and left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses back fromBuprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among the gods, and amongmortal men to Nestor.

　　"Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles isfor keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue ithereafter when the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, didnot Menoetius charge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthiato Agamemnon? Ulysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard allthat he said to you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus whilebeating up recruits throughout all Achaea, and when we got there wefound Menoetius and yourself, and Achilles with you. The old knightPeleus was in the outer court, roasting the fat thigh-bones of aheifer to Jove the lord of thunder; and he held a gold chalice inhis hand from which he poured drink-offerings of wine over the burningsacrifice. You two were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that momentwe stood at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led usby the hand into the house, placed us at table, and set before us suchhospitable entertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfiedourselves with meat and drink, I said my say and urged both of youto join us. You were ready enough to do so, and the two old mencharged you much and straitly. Old Peleus bade his son Achillesfight ever among the foremost and outvie his peers, while Menoetiusthe son of Actor spoke thus to you: 'My son,' said he, 'Achilles is ofnobler birth than you are, but you are older than he, though he is farthe better man of the two. Counsel him wisely, guide him in theright way, and he will follow you to his own profit.' Thus did yourfather charge you, but you have forgotten; nevertheless, even now, sayall this to Achilles if he will listen to you. Who knows but withheaven's help you may talk him over, for it is good to take a friend'sadvice. If, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his motherhas told him something from Jove, then let him send you, and let therest of the Myrmidons follow with you, if perchance you may bringlight and saving to the Danaans. And let him send you into battle cladin his own armour, that the Trojans may mistake you for him andleave off fighting; the sons of the Achaeans may thus have time to gettheir breath, for they are hard pressed and there is littlebreathing time in battle. You, who are fresh, might easily drive atired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents and ships."

　　With these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set offrunning by the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus.When he had got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was theirplace of assembly and court of justice, with their altars dedicated tothe gods, Eurypylus son of Euaemon met him, wounded in the thighwith an arrow, and limping out of the fight. Sweat rained from hishead and shoulders, and black blood welled from his cruel wound, buthis mind did not wander. The son of Menoetius when he saw him hadcompassion upon him and spoke piteously saying, "O unhappy princes andcounsellors of the Danaans, are you then doomed to feed the houndsof Troy with your fat, far from your friends and your native land?say, noble Eurypylus, will the Achaeans be able to hold great Hectorin check, or will they fall now before his spear?"

　　Wounded Eurypylus made answer, "Noble Patroclus, there is no hopeleft for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All theythat were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at thehands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But saveme and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash theblack blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it thosegracious herbs which, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles,who was himself shown them by Chiron, most righteous of all thecentaurs. For of the physicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear thatthe one is lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need ofhealing, while the other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain."

　　"Hero Eurypylus," replied the brave son of Menoetius, "how may thesethings be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to nobleAchilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even so Iwill not be unmindful your distress."

　　With this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,and a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground forhim to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharparrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound withwarm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between hishands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb whichkilled all pain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left offflowing.

　　BOOK XII

　　SO THE son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypyluswithin the tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately,nor were the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans incheck longer. They had built it to protect their ships, and had dugthe trench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and therich spoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombsto the gods. It had been built without the consent of the immortals,and therefore it did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achillesnursed his anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken,the great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of theTrojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some wereyet left alive when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenthyear, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to their owncountry- then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall, andthey turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount Ida intothe sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus, Aesopus,and goodly Scamander, with Simois, where many a shield and helm hadfallen, and many a hero of the race of demigods had bitten the dust.Phoebus Apollo turned the mouths of all these rivers together and madethem flow for nine days against the wall, while Jove rained thewhole time that he might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune himself,trident in hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea all thefoundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid with somuch toil; he made all level by the mighty stream of the Hellespont,and then when he had swept the wall away he spread a great beach ofsand over the place where it had been. This done he turned therivers back into their old courses.

　　This was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but asyet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till itstimbers rang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowedby the scourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear ofHector the mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought withthe force and fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turnsfiercely on the dogs and men that attack him, while these form solidwall and shower their javelins as they face him- his courage is allundaunted, but his high spirit will be the death of him; many a timedoes he charge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall backas often as he does so- even so did Hector go about among the hostexhorting his men, and cheering them on to cross the trench.

　　But the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink,for the width frightened them. They could neither jump it nor crossit, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, abovewhich there were the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans hadplanted so close and strong as a defence against all who wouldassail it; a horse, therefore, could not get into it and draw hischariot after him, but those who were on foot kept trying their veryutmost. Then Polydamas went up to Hector and said, "Hector, and youother captains of the Trojans and allies, it is madness for us totry and drive our horses across the trench; it will be very hard tocross, for it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these there is thewall. Our horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of nouse if they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come toharm. If, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in hisanger will utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly seethem perish now and here far from Argos; but if they should rallyand we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trenchthere will be not so much as a man get back to the city to tell thetale. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires hold ourhorses by the trench, but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, cladin full armour, and if the day of their doom is at hand the Achaeanswill not be able to withstand us."

　　Thus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang infull armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they sawhim do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horsesover to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at thetrench. Then they formed themselves into companies, made themselvesready, and in five bodies followed their leaders. Those that went withHector and Polydamas were the bravest and most in number, and the mostdetermined to break through the wall and fight at the ships. Cebrioneswas also joined with them as third in command, for Hector had left hischariot in charge of a less valiant soldier. The next company wasled by Paris, Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus andDeiphobus, two sons of Priam, and with them was the hero Asius-Asius the son of Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breedthat comes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe.Aeneas the valiant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sonsof Antenor, Archelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts ofwar. Sarpedon was captain over the allies, and took with him Glaucusand Asteropaeus whom he deemed most valiant after himself- for hewas far the best man of them all. These helped to array one another intheir ox-hide shields, and then charged straight at the Danaans, forthey felt sure that they would not hold out longer and that theyshould themselves now fall upon the ships.

　　The rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel ofPolydamas but Asius son of Hyrtacus would not leave his horses and hisesquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with himtowards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end inconsequence. Nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exultingin his chariot and his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omenedname had overshadowed him and he had fallen by the spear ofIdomeneus the noble son of Deucalion. He had driven towards the leftwing of the ships, by which way the Achaeans used to return with theirchariots and horses from the plain. Hither he drove and found thegates with their doors opened wide, and the great bar down- for thegatemen kept them open so as to let those of their comrades enterwho might be flying towards the ships. Hither of set purpose did hedirect his horses, and his men followed him with a loud cry, forthey felt sure that the Achaeans would not hold out longer, and thatthey should now fall upon the ships. Little did they know that atthe gates they should find two of the bravest chieftains, proud sonsof the fighting Lapithae- the one, Polypoetes, mighty son ofPirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous Mars. These stoodbefore the gates like two high oak trees upon the mountains, thattower from their wide-spreading roots, and year after year battle withwind and rain- even so did these two men await the onset of greatAsius confidently and without flinching. The Trojans led by him and byIamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius, Thoon and Oenomaus,raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the wall, holdingtheir shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for a while the twodefenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans on to stand firm inthe defence of their ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojanswere attacking the wall, while the Danaans were crying out for helpand being routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of the gateslike two wild boars upon the mountains that abide the attack of menand dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all roundthem tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the clattering oftheir tusks, till some one hits them and makes an end of them- even sodid the gleaming bronze rattle about their breasts, as the weaponsfell upon them; for they fought with great fury, trusting to their ownprowess and to those who were on the wall above them. These threwgreat stones at their assailants in defence of themselves theirtents and their ships. The stones fell thick as the flakes of snowwhich some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds and showers downin sheets upon the earth- even so fell the weapons from the handsalike of Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the greatstones rained upon them, and Asius the son of Hyrtacus in his dismaycried aloud and smote his two thighs. "Father Jove," he cried, "of atruth you too are altogether given to lying. I made sure the Argiveheroes could not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted wasps, orbees that have their nests in the rocks by the wayside- they leave notthe holes wherein they have built undefended, but fight for theirlittle ones against all who would take them- even so these men, thoughthey be but two, will not be driven from the gates, but stand firmeither to slay or be slain."

　　He spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it thenwas to give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans werefighting about the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able totell about all these things, for the battle raged everywhere about thestone wall as it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited thoughthey were, were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods whowere defending the Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithaekept on fighting with might and main.

　　Thereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with aspear upon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him,for the point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, sothat the brain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. Hethen slew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killedHippomachus the son of Antimachus by striking him with his spearupon the girdle. He then drew his sword and sprang first uponAntiphates whom he killed in combat, and who fell face upwards onthe earth. After him he killed Menon, Iamenus, and Orestes, and laidthem low one after the other.

　　While they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, theyouths who were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were thegreater part and the most valiant of those that were trying to breakthrough the wall and fire the ships) were still standing by thetrench, uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a sign fromheaven when they had essayed to cross it- a soaring eagle that flewskirting the left wing of their host, with a monstrous blood-red snakein its talons still alive and struggling to escape. The snake wasstill bent on revenge, wriggling and twisting itself backwards till itstruck the bird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the birdbeing in pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host,and then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans werestruck with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearingJove, writhing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hectorand said, "Hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebukeme, even when I speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth,that one of the people should cross your will either in the field orat the council board; you would have them support you always:nevertheless I will say what I think will be best; let us not now goon to fight the Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen ifthis soaring eagle which skirted the left wing of our with a monstrousblood-red snake in its talons (the snake being still alive) was reallysent as an omen to the Trojans on their essaying to cross thetrench. The eagle let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking ithome to her little ones, and so will it be- with ourselves; eventhough by a mighty effort we break through the gates and wall of theAchaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall not return ingood order by the way we came, but shall leave many a man behind uswhom the Achaeans will do to death in defence of their ships. Thuswould any seer who was expert in these matters, and was trusted by thepeople, read the portent."

　　Hector looked fiercely at him and said, "Polydamas, I like not ofyour reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will.If, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heavenrobbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to thecounsels of Jove, nor to the promises he made me- and he bowed hishead in confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight ofwild-fowl. What care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark, andwhether they be on my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trustrather in the counsel of great Jove, king of mortals and immortals.There is one omen, and one only- that a man should fight for hiscountry. Why are you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at theships of the Argives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for youare not steadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or wouldtalk others over from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before myspear."

　　With these words he led the way, and the others followed afterwith a cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent theblast of a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dustdown towards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into security, andgave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to theirown might and to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break throughthe great wall of the Achaeans. They tore down the breastworks fromthe walls, and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved thebuttresses, which the Achaeans had set in front of the wall in orderto support it; when they had pulled these down they made sure ofbreaking through the wall, but the Danaans still showed no sign ofgiving ground; they still fenced the battlements with their shields ofox-hide, and hurled their missiles down upon the foe as soon as anycame below the wall.

　　The two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on theAchaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to anyone whom they saw to be remiss. "My friends," they cried, "Argives oneand all- good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet, inwhich all were of equal prowess- there is now work enough, as you verywell know, for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flighttowards the ships, daunted by the shouting of the foe, but pressforward and keep one another in heart, if it may so be that OlympianJove the lord of lightning will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, anddrive them back towards the city."

　　Thus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on.As the flakes that fall thick upon a winter's day, when Jove is mindedto snow and to display these his arrows to mankind- he lulls thewind to rest, and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops ofthe high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassyplains, and the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon theforelands, and havens of the grey sea, but the waves as they comerolling in stay it that it can come no further, though all else iswrapped as with a mantle so heavy are the heavens with snow- even thusthickly did the stones fall on one side and on the other, somethrown at the Trojans, and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; andthe whole wall was in an uproar.

　　Still the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken downthe gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedonagainst the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle.Before him he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith hadbeaten so fair and round, and had lined with ox hides which he hadmade fast with rivets of gold all round the shield; this he held infront of him, and brandishing his two spears came on like some lion ofthe wilderness, who has been long famished for want of meat and willdare break even into a well-fenced homestead to try and get at thesheep. He may find the shepherds keeping watch over their flockswith dogs and spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from thefold till he has had a try for it; he will either spring on a sheepand carry it off, or be hit by a spear from strong hand- even so wasSarpedon fain to attack the wall and break down its battlements.Then he said to Glaucus son of Hippolochus, "Glaucus, why in Lyciado we receive especial honour as regards our place at table? Why arethe choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why domen look up to us as though we were gods? Moreover we hold a largeestate by the banks of the river Xanthus, fair with orchard lawnsand wheat-growing land; it becomes us, therefore, to take our stand atthe head of all the Lycians and bear the brunt of the fight, thatone may say to another, Our princes in Lycia eat the fat of the landand drink best of wine, but they are fine fellows; they fight well andare ever at the front in battle.' My good friend, if, when we wereonce out of this fight, we could escape old age and deaththenceforward and for ever, I should neither press forward myselfnor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand shapes hangs ever overour heads, and no man can elude him; therefore let us go forward andeither win glory for ourselves, or yield it to another."

　　Glaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host ofLycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them, forit was against his part of the wall that they came- bringingdestruction with them; he looked along the wall for some chieftainto support his comrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for thefray, and Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them;but he could not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great anuproar was there from crashing shields and helmets and the batteringof gates with a din which reached the skies. For all the gates hadbeen closed, and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and breaktheir way through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with amessage to Ajax. "Run, good Thootes," said and call Ajax, or betterstill bid both come, for it will be all over with us here directly;the leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever foughtdesperately heretofore. But if the have too much on their hands to letthem come, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucerthe famous bowman come with him."

　　The messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wallof the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, "Sirs,princes of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to himfor a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or itwill be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians areupon him, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you havetoo much on your hands to let both come, at any rate let Ajax son ofTelamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with him."

　　Great Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, and at once spoke tothe son of Oileus. "Ajax," said he, "do you two, yourself and braveLycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight theirhardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but Iwill come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help theyneed."

　　With this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer his brother bythe same father went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer's bow. Theywent along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower whereMenestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the bravecaptains and leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements asit were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raisingthe battle-cry aloud.

　　First, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade ofSarpedon, hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by thebattlements at the very top of the wall. As men now are, even onewho is in the bloom of youth could hardly lift it with his twohands, but Ajax raised it high aloft and flung it down, smashingEpicles' four-crested helmet so that the bones of his head werecrushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as though he werediving, with no more life left in him. Then Teucer wounded Glaucus thebrave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on to attack the wall. Hesaw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it, which made Glaucusleave off fighting. Thereon he sprang covertly down for fear some ofthe Achaeans might see that he was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon wasstung with grief when he saw Glaucus leave him, still he did not leaveoff fighting, but aimed his spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor andhit him. He drew his spear back again Alcmaon came down headlong afterit with his bronzed armour rattling round him. Then Sarpedon seizedthe battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it till it an gaveway together, and a breach was made through which many might pass.

　　Ajax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit himwith an arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body,but Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not fall bythe ships' sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced hisshield, but the spear did not go clean through, though it hustledhim back that he could come on no further. He therefore retired alittle space from the battlement, yet without losing all his ground,for he still thought to cover himself with glory. Then he turned roundand shouted to the brave Lycians saying, "Lycians, why do you thusfail me? For all my prowess I cannot break through the wall and open away to the ships single-handed. Come close on behind me, for themore there are of us the better."

　　The Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him whowas their counsellor their king. The Argives on their part got theirmen in fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly strugglebetween them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and forcetheir way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians fromthe wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rodsin hand, quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own incommon, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a merestrip, even so did the battlements now serve as a bone ofcontention, and they beat one another's round shields for theirpossession. Many a man's body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, ashe turned round and bared his back to the foe, and many were struckclean through their shields; the wall and battlements wereeverywhere deluged with the blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans.But even so the Trojans could not rout the Achaeans, who still heldon; and as some honest hard-working woman weighs wool in her balanceand sees that the scales be true, for she would gain some pitifulearnings for her little ones, even so was the fight balanced evenlybetween them till the time came when Jove gave the greater glory toHector son of Priam, who was first to spring towards the wall of theAchaeans. As he did so, he cried aloud to the Trojans, "Up, Trojans,break the wall of the Argives, and fling fire upon their ships."

　　Thus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight atthe wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements withsharp spears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay justoutside the gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other;two of the best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise itfrom the ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted itquite easily by himself, for the son of scheming Saturn made itlight for him. As a shepherd picks up a ram's fleece with one hand andfinds it no burden, so easily did Hector lift the great stone anddrive it right at the doors that closed the gates so strong and sofirmly set. These doors were double and high, and were kept closedby two cross-bars to which there was but one key. When he had gotclose up to them, Hector strode towards them that his blow mightgain in force and struck them in the middle, leaning his wholeweight against them. He broke both hinges, and the stone fell insideby reason of its great weight. The portals re-echoed with the sound,the bars held no longer, and the doors flew open, one one way, and theother the other, through the force of the blow. Then brave Hectorleaped inside with a face as dark as that of flying night. Thegleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had towspears in his hand. None but a god could have withstood him as heflung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared like fire. Then heturned round towards the Trojans and called on them to scale the wall,and they did as he bade them- some of them at once climbing over thewall, while others passed through the gates. The Danaans then fledpanic-stricken towards their ships, and all was uproar and confusion.

　　BOOK XIII

　　NOW when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to theships, he left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keeneyes away, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace,the Mysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, wholive on milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind. He no longerturned so much as a glance towards Troy, for he did not think that anyof the immortals would go and help either Trojans or Danaans.

　　But King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been lookingadmiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of woodedSamothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam andthe ships of the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and takenhis place here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcomeby the Trojans; and he was furiously angry with Jove.

　　Presently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and ashe strode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneaththe tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with thefourth he reached his goal- Aegae, where is his glittering goldenpalace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there,he yoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold allflying in the wind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped hisgold whip, and took his stand upon his chariot. As he went his wayover the waves the sea-monsters left their lairs, for they knewtheir lord, and came gambolling round him from every quarter of thedeep, while the sea in her gladness opened a path before hischariot. So lightly did the horses fly that the bronze axle of the carwas not even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took himto the ships of the Achaeans.

　　Now there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midwaybetween Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of theearthquake stayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before themtheir ambrosial forage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of goldwhich none could either unloose or break, so that they might staythere in that place until their lord should return. This done hewent his way to the host of the Achaeans.

　　Now the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like astorm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raisingthe cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of theAchaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there.Meanwhile earth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered onthe Argives, for he had come up out of the sea and had assumed theform and voice of Calchas.

　　First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,and said, "Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if youwill put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. I amnot afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force, willbe victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of themin check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here wherefurious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, isleading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put itinto your hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to dothe like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even thoughhe be inspired by Jove himself."

　　As he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struckboth of them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring.He made their legs light and active, as also their hands and theirfeet. Then, as the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above somesheer rock, and presently swoops down to chase some bird over theplain, even so did Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight intothe air and leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was thefirst to know who it was that had been speaking with them, and said toAjax son of Telamon, "Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell onOlympus, who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hardby our ships. It was not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knewhim at once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the godsare soon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn morefiercely within me, while my hands and my feet under me are more eagerfor the fray."

　　And Ajax son of Telamon answered, "I too feel my hands grasp myspear more firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble;I long, moreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even insingle combat."

　　Thus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle withwhich the god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler rousedthe Achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome atonce by hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans hadgot over the wall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes asthey beheld them, for they made sure that they should not escapedestruction; but the lord of the earthquake passed lightly about amongthem and urged their battalions to the front.

　　First he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, andThoas and Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors;all did he exhort. "Shame on you young Argives," he cried, "it wason your prowess I relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight notwith might and main, this very day will see us overcome by theTrojans. Of a truth my eyes behold a great and terrible portentwhich I had never thought to see- the Trojans at our ships- they,who were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals andwolves in a forest, with no strength but in flight for they cannotdefend themselves. Hitherto the Trojans dared not for one momentface the attack of the Achaeans, but now they have sallied far fromtheir city and are fighting at our very ships through the cowardice ofour leader and the disaffection of the people themselves, who in theirdiscontent care not to fight in defence of the ships but are beingslaughtered near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus is the causeof our disaster by having insulted the son of Peleus, still this is noreason why we should leave off fighting. Let us be quick to heal,for the hearts of the brave heal quickly. You do ill to be thusremiss, you, who are the finest soldiers in our whole army. I blame noman for keeping out of battle if he is a weakling, but I amindignant with such men as you are. My good friends, matters will soonbecome even worse through this slackness; think, each one of you, ofhis own honour and credit, for the hazard of the fight is extreme.Great Hector is now fighting at our ships; he has broken through thegates and the strong bolt that held them."

　　Thus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge themon. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men,of whom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could makelight if they went among them, for they were the picked men of allthose who were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans.They made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler tobuckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests ontheir gleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward,so closely seffied were they; the spears they brandished in theirstrong hands were interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle.

　　The Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their headpressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side ofsome mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; thefoundations of the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain,and as it bounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in anuproar; it swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches levelground, but then for all its fury it can go no further- even so easilydid Hector for a while seem as though he would career through thetents and ships of the Achaeans till he had reached the sea in hismurderous course; but the closely serried battalions stayed him whenhe reached them, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at him withswords and spears pointed at both ends, and drove him from them sothat he staggered and gave ground; thereon he shouted to theTrojans, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in closecombat, stand firm: the Achaeans have set themselves as a wall againstme, but they will not check me for long; they will give groundbefore me if the mightiest of the gods, the thundering spouse of Juno,has indeed inspired my onset."

　　With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobusson of Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring withhis round shield before him, under cover of which he strode quicklyforward. Meriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hitthe broad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for thespear broke in two pieces long ere he could do so; moreoverDeiphobus had seen it coming and had held his shield well away fromhim. Meriones drew back under cover of his comrades, angry alike athaving failed to vanquish Deiphobus, and having broken his spear. Heturned therefore towards the ships and tents to fetch a spear which hehad left behind in his tent.

　　The others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up intothe heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man, towit, the warrior Imbrius son of Mentor rich in horses. Until theAchaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste abastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet hehad gone back to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans,dwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like honour with his ownsons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spearwhich he then drew back again, and Imbrius fell headlong as anash-tree when it is felled on the crest of some high mountainbeacon, and its delicate green foliage comes toppling down to theground. Thus did he fall with his bronze-dight armour ringingharshly round him, and Teucer sprang forward with intent to striphim of his armour; but as he was doing so, Hector took aim at him witha spear. Teucer saw the spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hitAmphimachus, son of Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he wascoming into battle, and his armour rang rattling round him as hefell heavily to the ground. Hector sprang forward to takeAmphimachus's helmet from off his temples, and in a moment Ajaxthrew a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased allover in his terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss ofhis shield with such force as to drive him back from the twocorpses, which the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus,captains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to the host of theAchaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the like byImbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that have it intheir fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high above the groundin their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrius, andstrip it of its armour. Then the son of Oileus severed the head fromthe neck in revenge for the death of Amphimachus, and sent it whirlingover the crowd as though it had been a ball, till fell in the dustat Hector's feet.

　　Neptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus shouldhave fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of theAchaeans to urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for theTrojans. Idomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, whohad just come to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. Hisfellow-soldiers bore him off the field, and Idomeneus having givenorders to the physicians went on to his tent, for he was stillthirsting for battle. Neptune spoke in the likeness and with the voiceof Thoas son of Andraemon who ruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron andhigh Calydon, and was honoured among his people as though he were agod. "Idomeneus," said he, "lawgiver to the Cretans, what has nowbecome of the threats with which the sons of the Achaeans used tothreaten the Trojans?"

　　And Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, "Thoas, no one, sofar as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held backneither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the of almighty Jovethat the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos: you,Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart if yousee any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to dotheir utmost."

　　To this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, "Idomeneus,may he never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to battenupon, who is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armourand go, we must make all haste together if we may be of any use,though we are only two. Even cowards gain courage fromcompanionship, and we two can hold our own with the bravest."

　　Therewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, andIdomeneus when he had reached his tent donned his armour, graspedhis two spears, and sallied forth. As the lightning which the son ofSaturn brandishes from bright Olympus when he would show a sign tomortals, and its gleam flashes far and wide- even so did his armourgleam about him as he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire met him while hewas still near his tent (for he was going to fetch his spear) andIdomeneus said

　　"Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you leftthe field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurtingyou? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I hadfar rather fight than stay in my tent."

　　"Idomeneus," answered Meriones, "I come for a spear, if I can findone in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at theshield of Deiphobus."

　　And Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, "You will find onespear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall ofmy tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for I amnot one to keep my enemy at arm's length; therefore I have spears,bossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets."

　　Then Meriones said, "I too in my tent and at my ship have spoilstaken from the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at alltimes valorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held myown among the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who donot know how I fight, but you know it well enough yourself."

　　Idomeneus answered, "I know you for a brave man: you need not tellme. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush-and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of; itcomes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will changecolour at every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keepsshifting his weight first on one knee and then on the other; his heartbeats fast as he thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering ofhis teeth; whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be onfinding himself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go intoaction- if the best men were being chosen for such a service, no onecould make light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struckby a dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind,in your neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest orbelly as you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks.But let us no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be illspoken of; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once."

　　On this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself aspear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with greatdeeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and hisson Panic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror eveninto the heart of a hero- the pair have gone from Thrace to armthemselves among the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they willnot listen to both the contending hosts, and will give victory toone side or to the other- even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captainsof men, go out to battle clad in their bronze armour. Meriones wasfirst to speak. "Son of Deucalion," said he, "where would you haveus begin fighting? On the right wing of the host, in the centre, or onthe left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?"

　　Idomeneus answered, "There are others to defend the centre- thetwo Ajaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans,and is good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector sonof Priam enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard tovanquish their indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son ofSaturn fling a firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax sonof Telamon will yield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats thegrain of Ceres, if bronze and great stones can overthrow him. He wouldnot yield even to Achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetnessof foot there is none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards theleft wing, that we may know forthwith whether we are to give gloryto some other, or he to us."

　　Meriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to thepart of the host which Idomeneus had named.

　　Now when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire,him and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shoutedand made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fightraged under the ships' sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistleupon a day when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise itinto a thick cloud- even such was the fury of the combat, and mightand main did they hack at each other with spear and sword throughoutthe host. The field bristled with the long and deadly spears whichthey bore. Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, theirfresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they joinedbattle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage who couldtake pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look on it withoutbeing dismayed.

　　Thus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortalheroes. Jove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and toHector, so as to do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he didnot mean to utterly overthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, andonly wanted to glorify Thetis and her valiant son. Neptune on theother hand went about among the Argives to incite them, having come upfrom the grey sea in secret, for he was grieved at seeing themvanquished by the Trojans, and was furiously angry with Jove. Bothwere of the same race and country, but Jove was elder born and knewmore, therefore Neptune feared to defend the Argives openly, but inthe likeness of man, he kept on encouraging them throughout theirhost. Thus, then, did these two devise a knot of war and battle,that none could unloose or break, and set both sides tugging at it, tothe failing of men's knees beneath them.

　　And now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,called loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as heleaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner,who had but lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandrathe fairest of Priam's daughters in marriage, but offered no giftsof wooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he woulddrive the sons of the Achaeans willy nilly from Troy; old King Priamhad given his consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought onthe strength of the promises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed aspear, and hit him as he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze didnot protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly, so that he fellheavily to the ground. Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying,"Othryoneus, there is no one in the world whom I shall admire morethan I do you, if you indeed perform what you have promised Priamson of Dardanus in return for his daughter. We too will make you anoffer; we will give you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus,and will bring her from Argos for you to marry, if you will sack thegoodly city of Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along with me,that we may make a covenant at the ships about the marriage, and wewill not be hard upon you about gifts of wooing."

　　With this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thickof the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in frontof his horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that hecould feel their 'breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strikedown Idomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with hisspear in the throat under the chin, and the bronze point went cleanthrough it. He fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrightshave felled for ship's timber upon the mountains with whetted axes-even thus did he lie full length in front of his chariot and horses,grinding his teeth and clutching at the bloodstained just. Hischarioteer was struck with panic and did not dare turn his horsesround and escape: thereupon Antilochus hit him in the middle of hisbody with a spear; his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, andthe spear stuck in his belly. He fell gasping from his chariot andAntilochus great Nestor's son, drove his horses from the Trojans tothe Achaeans.

　　Deiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, andtook aim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out andavoided it, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore- ashield of oxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. Hecrouched under cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but theshield rang out as the spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not invain from the strong hand of Deiphobus, for it struck Hypsenor sonof Hippasus, shepherd of his people, in the liver under the midriff,and his limbs failed beneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and criedwith a loud voice saying, "Of a truth Asius has not fallenunavenied; he will be glad even while passing into the house of Hades,strong warden of the gate, that I have sent some one to escort him."

　　Thus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. NobleAntilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make himforget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, andcovered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades,Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor stooped down, and bore him awaygroaning heavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. Hekept on striving continually either to enshroud some Trojan in thedarkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil dayfrom the Achaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes: he wasson-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameiawho was the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all hergeneration in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, whereforethe bravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife- him did Neptune laylow by the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding hisstrong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to oneside, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneusstruck him with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mailthat had hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rangharshly as the spear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground,and the spear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made thebutt-end of the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life.Idomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,"Deiphobus, since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits nowthat we have killed three men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fightwith me yourself, that you may learn what manner of Jove-begottenman am I that have come hither. Jove first begot Minos chief rulerin Crete, and Minos in his turn begot a son, noble Deucalion;Deucalion begot me to be a ruler over many men in Crete, and myships have now brought me hither, to be the bane of yourself, yourfather, and the Trojans."

　　Thus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to goback and fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up thechallenge single-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetchAeneas, whom he found standing in the rear, for he had long beenaggrieved with Priam because in spite his brave deeds he did notgive him his due share of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said,"Aeneas, prince among the Trojans, if you know any ties of kinship,help me now to defend the body of your sister's husband; come withme to the rescue of Alcathous, who being husband to your sisterbrought you up when you were a child in his house, and now Idomeneushas slain him."

　　With these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went inpursuit of Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneuswas not to be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held hisground as a wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the comingof a great crowd of men in some lonely place- the bristles standupright on his back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks inhis eagerness to defend himself against hounds and men- even so didfamed Idomeneus hold his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas.He cried aloud to his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus,Deipyrus, Meriones, and Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers-"Hither my friends," he cried, "and leave me not single-handed- I goin great fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is aredoubtable dispenser of death battle. Moreover he is in the flower ofyouth when a man's strength is greatest; if I was of the same age ashe is and in my present mind, either he or I should soon bear away theprize of victory

　　On this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield onshoulder. Aeneas on the other side called to his comrades, lookingtowards Deiphobus, Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of theTrojans along with himself, and the people followed them as sheepfollow the ram when they go down to drink after they have beenfeeding, and the heart of the shepherd is glad- even so was theheart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him.

　　Then they fought furiously in close combat about the body ofAlcathous, wielding their long spears; and the bronze armour abouttheir bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at one another in thepress of the fight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peersof Mars, outxied every one in their desire to hack at each otherwith sword and spear. Aeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was onthe lookout and avoided the spear, so that it sped from Aeneas' stronghand in vain, and fell quivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhilesmote Oenomaus in the middle of his belly, and broke the plate ofhis corslet, whereon his bowels came gushing out and he clutched theearth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.Idomeneus drew his spear out of the body, but could not strip him ofthe rest of his armour for the rain of darts that were showered uponhim: moreover his strength was now beginning to fail him so that hecould no longer charge, and could neither spring forward to recoverhis own weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was aimed at him;therefore, though he still defended himself in hand-to-hand fight, hisheavy feet could not bear him swiftly out of the battle. Deiphobusaimed a spear at him as he was retreating slowly from the field, forhis bitterness against him was as fierce as ever, but again hemissed him, and hit Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; the spear wentthrough his shoulder, and he clutched the earth in the palms of hishands as he fell sprawling in the dust.

　　Grim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen,for he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the goldenclouds, by command of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting,forbidden to take part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiouslyabout the body. Deiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, butMeriones sprang upon him, and struck him on the arm with a spear sothat the visored helmet fell from his hand and came ringing downupon the ground. Thereon Meriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drewthe spear from his shoulder, and fell back under cover of his men.Then Polites, own brother of Deiphobus passed his arms around hiswaist, and bore him away from the battle till he got to his horsesthat were standing in the rear of the fight with the chariot and theirdriver. These took him towards the city groaning and in great pain,with the blood flowing from his arm.

　　The others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heavenwithout ceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, andstruck him with a spear in his throat which was turned towards him;his head fell on one side, his helmet and shield came down alongwith him, and death, life's foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spiedhis chance, flew forward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he wasturning round. He laid open the vein that runs all the way up the backto the neck; he cut this vein clean away throughout its wholecourse, and Thoon fell in the dust face upwards, stretching out hishands imploringly towards his comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him andstripped the armour from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully ashe did so. The Trojans came about him on every side and struck hisbroad and gleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptunestood guard over the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thicklyround him. He was never clear of the foe, but was always in thethick of the fight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed itin every direction, so eager was he to hit some one from a distance orto fight him hand to hand.

　　As he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas sonof Asius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in themiddle of his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, forhe grudged him the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of thespear stuck fast like a charred stake in Antilochus's shield, whilethe other lay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover ofhis men, but Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midwaybetween the private parts and the navel, where a wound is particualrlypainful to wretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and hewrithed convulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountainherdsmen have bound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce.Even so did he move convulsively for a while, but not for very long,till Meriones came up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyeswere veiled in darkness.

　　Helenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hittinghim on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from hishead; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who werefighting on the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at hisfeet, but the eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.

　　On this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,brandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the twoattacked one another at one and the same moment, the one with hisspear, and the other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hitthe breastplate of Menelaus's corslet, but the arrow glanced fromoff it. As black beans or pulse come pattering down on to athreshing-floor from the broad winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill windsand shaken by the shovel- even so did the arrow glance off andrecoil from the shield of Menelaus, who in his turn wounded the handwith which Helenus carried his bow; the spear went right through hishand and stuck in the bow itself, so that to his life he retreatedunder cover of his men, with his hand dragging by his side- for thespear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out and bound the handcarefully up in a woollen sling which his esquire had with him.

　　Pisander then made straight at Menelaus- his evil destiny luring himon to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus. Whenthe two were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus turnedaside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield ofbrave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed thespear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure ofvictory; forthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword andsprang upon him. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, withits long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side underhis shield, and the two made at one another. Pisander struck thepeak of Menelaus's crested helmet just under the crest itself, andMenelaus hit Pisander as he was coming towards him, on the forehead,just at the rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his twogore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his feet in the dust. He fell backwardsto the ground, and Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of hisarmour, and vaunted over him saying, "Even thus shall you Trojansleave the ships of the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battlethough you be: nor shall you lack any of the disgrace and shamewhich you have heaped upon myself. Cowardly she-wolves that you are,you feared not the anger of dread Jove, avenger of violatedhospitality, who will one day destroy your city; you stole my weddedwife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were her guest,and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. Aday will come when, rage as you may, you shall be stayed. O fatherJove, you, who they say art above all both gods and men in wisdom, andfrom whom all things that befall us do proceed, how can you thusfavour the Trojans- men so proud and overweening, that they arenever tired of fighting? All things pall after a while- sleep, love,sweet song, and stately dance- still these are things of which a manwould surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is ofbattle that the Trojans are insatiate."

　　So saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the bodyof Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again rangedhimself among those who were in the front of the fight.

　　Harpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had cometo fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go homeagain. He struck the middle of Menelaus's shield with his spear butcould not pierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of hismen, looking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. ButMeriones aimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving thefield, and hit him on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bonethrough and through, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat downwhere he was and breathed his last in the arms of his comrades,stretched like a worm upon the ground and watering the earth withthe blood that flowed from his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tendedhim with all due care; they raised him into his chariot, and borehim sadly off to the city of Troy; his father went also with himweeping bitterly, but there was no ransom that could bring his deadson to life again.

　　Paris was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his hostwhen he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, inorder to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor, sonof Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was inCorinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that itwould be the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus hadoften told him that he must either stay at home and die of aterrible disease, or go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands ofthe Trojans; he chose, therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy finethe Achaeans would have laid upon him, and at the same time toescape the pain and suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on thejaw under his ear, whereon the life went out of him and he wasenshrouded in the darkness of death.

　　Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector hadnot yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havocof his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere longwould have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer themon and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he had firstforced his way through the gates and the wall, after breakingthrough the serried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that theships of Ajax and Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here thewall was at its lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged mostfiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics, theLocrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeanscould hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, norcould they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. Thechosen men of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus sonof Peteos, with whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias:Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius commanded the Epeans, whileMedon and staunch Podarces led the men of Phthia. Of these, Medonwas bastard son to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylaceaway from his own country, for he had killed the brother of hisstepmother Eriopis, the wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was theson of Iphiclus son of Phylacus. These two stood in the van of thePhthians, and defended the ships along with the Boeotians.

　　Ajax son of Oileus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son ofTelamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at theplough which they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweatsteams upwards from about the roots of their horns- nothing but theyoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach theend of the field- even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder toshoulder by one another. Many and brave comrades followed the son ofTelamon, to relieve him of his shield when he was overcome withsweat and toil, but the Locrians did not follow so close after the sonof Oileus, for they could not hold their own in a hand-to-handfight. They had no bronze helmets with plumes of horse-hair, neitherhad they shields nor ashen spears, but they had come to Troy armedwith bows, and with slings of twisted wool from which they showeredtheir missiles to break the ranks of the Trojans. The others,therefore, with their heavy armour bore the brunt of the fight withthe Trojans and with Hector, while the Locrians shot from behind,under their cover; and thus the Trojans began to lose heart, for thearrows threw them into confusion.

　　The Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from theships and tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presentlysaid to Hector, "Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice.Because heaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, youthink that you must therefore excel others in counsel; but youcannot thus claim preeminence in all things. Heaven has made one manan excellent soldier; of another it has made a dancer or a singerand player on the lyre; while yet in another Jove has implanted a wiseunderstanding of which men reap fruit to the saving of many, and hehimself knows more about it than any one; therefore I will say whatI think will be best. The fight has hemmed you in as with a circleof fire, and even now that the Trojans are within the wall some ofthem stand aloof in full armour, while others are fighting scatteredand outnumbered near the ships. Draw back, therefore, and call yourchieftains round you, that we may advise together whether to fallnow upon the ships in the hope that heaven may vouchsafe us victory,or to beat a retreat while we can yet safely do so. I greatly fearthat the Achaeans will pay us their debt of yesterday in full, forthere is one abiding at their ships who is never weary of battle,and who will not hold aloof much longer."

　　Thus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprangin full armour from his chariot and said, "Polydamas, gather thechieftains here; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return atonce when I have given them their orders."

　　He then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loudcry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. Whenthey heard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas theexcellent son of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost,looking everywhere to find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son ofAsius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless hecould no longer find them, for the two last were lying by the sternsof the Achaean ships, slain by the Argives, while the others hadbeen also stricken and wounded by them; but upon the left wing ofthe dread battle he found Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen,cheering his men and urging them on to fight. He went up to him andupbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris, fair to seebut woman-mad and false of tongue, where are Deiphobus and KingHelenus? Where are Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus?Where too is Othryoneus? Ilius is undone and will now surely fall!"

　　Alexandrus answered, "Hector, why find fault when there is no one tofind fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day ratherthan this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward aboutme. From the moment when you set our men fighting about the ships wehave been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comradesabout whom you ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alonehave left the field, wounded both of them in the hand, but the sonof Saturn saved them alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you wouldhave us go, and we will follow with right goodwill; you shall not findus fail you in so far as our strength holds out, but no man can domore than in him lies, no matter how willing he may be."

　　With these words he satisfied his brother, and the two wenttowards the part of the battle where the fight was thickest, aboutCebriones, brave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes,Palmys, Ascanius, and Morys son of Hippotion, who had come fromfertile Ascania on the preceding day to relieve other troops. ThenJove urged them on to fight. They flew forth like the blasts of somefierce wind that strike earth in the van of a thunderstorm- theybuffet the salt sea into an uproar; many and mighty are the greatwaves that come crashing in one after the other upon the shore withtheir arching heads all crested with foam- even so did rank behindrank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming armour follow their leadersonward. The way was led by Hector son of Priam, peer of murderousMars, with his round shield before him- his shield of ox-hides coveredwith plates of bronze- and his gleaming helmet upon his temples. Hekept stepping forward under cover of his shield in every direction,making trial of the ranks to see if they would give way be him, but hecould not daunt the courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first tostride out and challenge him. "Sir," he cried, "draw near; why doyou think thus vainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellentsoldiers, but the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Yourheart, forsooth, is set on destroying our ships, but we too have bandsthat can keep you at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner takenand sacked by ourselves. The time is near when you shall pray Jove andall the gods in your flight, that your steeds may be swifter thanhawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bear you back to yourcity."

　　As he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, andthe host of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. ButHector answered, "Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that Iwere as sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, withQueen Juno for my mother, and of being held in like honour withMinerva and Apollo, as I am that this day is big with thedestruction of the Achaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dareabide my spear; it shall rend your fair body and bid you glut ourhounds and birds of prey with your fat and your flesh, as you fallby the ships of the Achaeans."

　　With these words he led the way and the others followed after with acry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argiveson their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget theirprowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojanchieftains, and the cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and tothe brightness of Jove's presence.

　　BOOK XIV

　　NESTOR was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did notescape him, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, "What, nobleMachaon, is the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by ourships grow stronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit overyour wine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clottedblood from off you. I will go at once to the look-out station andsee what it is all about."

　　As he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that waslying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had takenhis father's shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, andas soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans who,now that their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before theTrojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the wavesare dumb- they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence thefierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are andset neither this way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps downfrom heaven to determine them- even so did the old man ponderwhether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search ofAgamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus;but meanwhile the hosts were fighting and killing one another, and thehard bronze rattled on their bodies, as they thrust at one anotherwith their swords and spears.

　　The wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon sonof Atreus, fell in Nestor as they were coming up from their ships- fortheirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was going on,being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached first,while the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch ofthe shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all theships, and the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placedthe ships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the wholeopening of the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings,leaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being ingreat anxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled withdismay. Then King Agamemnon said to him, "Nestor son of Neleus, honourto the Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? Ifear that what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted amongthe Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had firedour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is allcoming true. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in angerwith me that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships."

　　Then Nestor knight of Gerene answered, "It is indeed as you say;it is all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thundersfrom on high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which werelied as an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. TheTrojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; lookwhere you may you cannot see from what quarter the rout of theAchaeans is coming; they are being killed in a confused mass and thebattle-cry ascends to heaven; let us think, if counsel can be of anyuse, what we had better do; but I do not advise our going intobattle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is wounded."

　　And King Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, if the Trojans are indeedfighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trenchhas served us- over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which theydeemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet- Isee it must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perishingloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing todefend us, and I know now that he is raising the Trojans to likehonour with the gods, while us, on the other hand, he bas bound handand foot. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring downthe ships that are on the beach and draw them into the water; let usmake them fast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against thefall of night- if even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting;we may then draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong inflying ruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should flyand be saved than be caught and killed."

　　Ulysses looked fiercely at him and said, "Son of Atreus, what areyou talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other andbaser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted alife of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of usperish. Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to winwhich we have suffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest someother of the Achaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to givegood counsel, no king over so great a host as that of the Argivesshould ever have let fall from his lips. I despise your judgementutterly for what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us drawdown our ships into the water while the battle is raging, and thusplay further into the hands of the conquering Trojans? It would beruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting when they see the shipsbeing drawn into the water, but will cease attacking and keepturning their eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir captain,would be our destruction."

　　Agamemnon answered, "Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart.I am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships intothe sea whether they will or no. Some one, it may be, old or young,can offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice to hear."

　　Then said Diomed, "Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, ifyou will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am youngerthan any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who liesburied at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,Agrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third wasthe knight Oeneus, my father's father, and he was the most valiantof them all. Oeeneus remained in his own country, but my father (asJove and the other gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He marriedinto the family of Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance,for he had large estates of rich corn-growing land, with muchorchard ground as well, and he had many sheep; moreover he excelledall the Argives in the use of the spear. You must yourselves haveheard whether these things are true or no; therefore when I say welldespise not my words as though I were a coward or of ignoble birth.I say, then, let us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded thoughwe be. When there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond therange of the spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what wehave already, but we can spur on others, who have been indulging theirspleen and holding aloof from battle hitherto."

　　Thus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,King Agamemnon leading the way.

　　Meanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them inthe semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon's right hand in his ownand said, "Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that hesees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse-may he come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself, theblessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that theprinces and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust uponthe plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tentstowards their city."

　　With this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward tothe plain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nineor ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight,and it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage warand do battle without ceasing.

　　Juno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak ofOlympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was atonce her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thitheramid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on thetopmost crests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She setherself to think how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemedthat it would be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in richattire, in the hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, andwish to embrace her. While he was thus engaged a sweet and carelesssleep might be made to steal over his eyes and senses.

　　She went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had madeher, and the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of asecret key so that no other god could open them. Here she enteredand closed the doors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from herfair body with ambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil,ambrosial, very soft, and scented specially for herself- if it were somuch as shaken in the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervadedthe universe of heaven and earth. With this she anointed herdelicate skin, and then she plaited the fair ambrosial locks thatflowed in a stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. She puton the wondrous robe which Minerva had worked for her withconsummate art, and had embroidered with manifold devices; shefastened it about her bosom with golden clasps, and she girded herselfwith a girdle that had a hundred tassels: then she fastened herearrings, three brilliant pendants that glistened most beautifully,through the pierced lobes of her ears, and threw a lovely new veilover her head. She bound her sandals on to her feet, and when shehad arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction, she left her roomand called Venus to come aside and speak to her. "My dear child," saidshe, "will you do what I am going to ask of you, or will refuse mebecause you are angry at my being on the Danaan side, while you are onthe Trojan?"

　　Jove's daughter Venus answered, "Juno, august queen of goddesses,daughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it forat once, if I can, and if it can be done at all."

　　Then Juno told her a lying tale and said, "I want you to endow mewith some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring allthings mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world's endto visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys:they received me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up,having taken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn inthe depths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them that Imay make peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and are soangry that they have not slept with one another this long while; ifI can bring them round and restore them to one another's embraces,they will be grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards."

　　Thereon laughter-loving Venus said, "I cannot and must not refuseyou, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king."

　　As she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroideredgirdle into which all her charms had been wrought- love, desire, andthat sweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the mostprudent. She gave the girdle to Juno and said, "Take this girdlewherein all my charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you willwear it I promise you that your errand, be it what it may, will not bebootless."

　　When she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid thegirdle in her bosom.

　　Venus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted downfrom the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fairEmathia, and went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of theThracian horsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without eversetting foot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the,waves of the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas.There she met Sleep, own brother to Death, and caught him by the hand,saying, "Sleep, you who lord it alike over mortals and immortals, ifyou ever did me a service in times past, do one for me now, and Ishall be grateful to you ever after. Close Jove's keen eyes for mein slumber while I hold him clasped in my embrace, and I will give youa beautiful golden seat, that can never fall to pieces; myclubfooted son Vulcan shall make it for you, and he shall give it afootstool for you to rest your fair feet upon when you are at table."

　　Then Sleep answered, "Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter ofmighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep withoutcompunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all ofthem proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleepunless he bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing whatyou asked me, on the day when Jove's mighty son Hercules set sail fromIlius after having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding Isuffused my sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laidhim to rest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and setthe blasts of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you tookhim to the goodly city of Cos away from all his friends. Jove wasfurious when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over thehouse; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would haveflung me down through space into the sea where I should never havebeen heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and godsprotected me. I fled to her and Jove left off looking for me inspite of his being so angry, for he did not dare do anything todisplease Night. And now you are again asking me to do something onwhich I cannot venture."

　　And Juno said, "Sleep, why do you take such notions as those intoyour head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans,as he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of theyoungest of the Graces, and she shall be your own- Pasithea, whomyou have always wanted to marry."

　　Sleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, "Then swear itto me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on thebounteous earth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that allthe gods who dwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, andsee that you really do give me one of the youngest of the Graces-Pasithea, whom I have always wanted to marry."

　　Juno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods ofthe nether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she hadcompleted her oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mistand sped lightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them.Presently they reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, andLectum where they left the sea to go on by land, and the tops of thetrees of the forest soughed under the going of their feet. HereSleep halted, and ere Jove caught sight of him he climbed a loftypine-tree- the tallest that reared its head towards heaven on all Ida.He hid himself behind the branches and sat there in the semblance ofthe sweet-singing bird that haunts the mountains and is called Chalcisby the gods, but men call it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, thetopmost peak of Ida, and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes uponher. As soon as he did so he became inflamed with the samepassionate desire for her that he had felt when they had first enjoyedeach other's embraces, and slept with one another without their dearparents knowing anything about it. He went up to her and said, "Whatdo you want that you have come hither from Olympus- and that toowith neither chariot nor horses to convey you?"

　　Then Juno told him a lying tale and said, "I am going to the world'send, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and motherTethys; they received me into their house, took care of me, andbrought me up. I must go and see them that I may make peace betweenthem: they have been quarrelling, and are so angry that they havenot slept with one another this long time. The horses that will takeme over land and sea are stationed on the lowermost spurs ofmany-fountained Ida, and I have come here from Olympus on purpose toconsult you. I was afraid you might be angry with me later on, if Iwent to the house of Oceanus without letting you know."

　　And Jove said, "Juno, you can choose some other time for paying yourvisit to Oceanus- for the present let us devote ourselves to loveand to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been sooverpowered by passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am atthis moment for yourself- not even when I was in love with the wife ofIxion who bore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet withDanae the daintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me thefamed hero Perseus. Then there was the daughter of Phoenix, who boreme Minos and Rhadamanthus: there was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebesby whom I begot my lion-hearted son Hercules, while Semele becamemother to Bacchus the comforter of mankind. There was queen Ceresagain, and lovely Leto, and yourself- but with none of these was Iever so much enamoured as I now am with you."

　　Juno again answered him with a lying tale. "Most dread son ofSaturn," she exclaimed, "what are you talking about? Would you have usenjoy one another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything canbe seen? What if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleepingtogether, and tell the others? It would be such a scandal that whenI had risen from your embraces I could never show myself inside yourhouse again; but if you are so minded, there is a room which yourson Vulcan has made me, and he has given it good strong doors; ifyou would so have it, let us go thither and lie down."

　　And Jove answered, "Juno, you need not be afraid that either godor man will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a densegolden cloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beamsshall not see through it."

　　With this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace;whereon the earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, withdew-bespangled lotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick thatit raised them well above the ground. Here they laid themselves downand overhead they were covered by a fair cloud of gold, from whichthere fell glittering dew-drops.

　　Thus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on thecrest of Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held hisspouse in his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of theAchaeans, to tell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake.When he had found him he said, "Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaanswith a will, and give them victory though it be only for a shorttime while Jove is still sleeping. I have sent him into a sweetslumber, and Juno has beguiled him into going to bed with her."

　　Sleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind,leaving Neptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He dartedforward among the first ranks and shouted saying, "Argives, shall welet Hector son of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships andcovering himself with glory? This is what he says that he shall nowdo, seeing that Achilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall geton very well without him if we keep each other in heart and stand byone another. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us eachtake the best and largest shield we can lay hold of, put on ourhelmets, and sally forth with our longest spears in our hands; willlead you on, and Hector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare tohold out against us. If any good staunch soldier has only a smallshield, let him hand it over to a worse man, and take a larger one forhimself."

　　Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son ofTydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set theothers in array, and went about everywhere effecting the exchangesof armour; the most valiant took the best armour, and gave the worseto the worse man. When they had donned their bronze armour theymarched on with Neptune at their head. In his strong hand he graspedhis terrible sword, keen of edge and flashing like lightning; woe tohim who comes across it in the day of battle; all men quake for fearand keep away from it.

　　Hector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptuneand Hector waged fierce war on one another- Hector on the Trojan andNeptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forcesmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of theAchaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly whendriven before the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forestfire roar more fiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nordoes the wind bellow with ruder music as it tears on through thetops of when it is blowing its hardest, than the terrible shoutwhich the Trojans and Achaeans raised as they sprang upon one another.

　　Hector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towardshim, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bandspassed over his chest- the band of his shield and that of hissilver-studded sword- and these protected his body. Hector was angrythat his spear should have been hurled in vain, and withdrew undercover of his men. As he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamonstruck him with a stone, of which there were many lying about underthe men's feet as they fought- brought there to give support to theships' sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of themand struck Hector above the rim of his shield close to his neck; theblow made him spin round like a top and reel in all directions. Asan oak falls headlong when uprooted by the lightning flash of fatherJove, and there is a terrible smell of brimstone- no man can helpbeing dismayed if he is standing near it, for a thunderbolt is avery awful thing- even so did Hector fall to earth and bite thedust. His spear fell from his hand, but his shield and helmet weremade fast about his body, and his bronze armour rang about him.

　　The sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,hoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,but none of them could wound him before he was surrounded andcovered by the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captainof the Lycians, and noble Glaucus: of the others, too, there was notone who was unmindful of him, and they held their round shields overhim to cover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and borehim away from the battle to the place where his horses stood waitingfor him at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot;these then took him towards the city groaning and in great pain.When they reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthus, begotten ofImmortal Jove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down onthe ground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathedagain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomitedblood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were againclosed in darkness for he was still sturined by the blow.

　　When the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart andset upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileusbegan by springing on Satnius son of Enops and wounding him with hisspear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herdingcattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus cameup to him and struck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fiercefight between Trojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamasson of Panthous drew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son ofAreilycus on the right shoulder; the terrible spear went right throughhis shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust.Polydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, "Again I take it that thespear has not sped in vain from the strong hand of the son ofPanthous; an Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve himfor a staff as he goes down into the house of Hades."

　　The Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamonwas more angry than any, for the man had fallen close be, him; so heaimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himselfby swerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, forheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the headsprings from the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severedboth the tendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, andnostrils reached the ground long before his legs and knees could doso, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying, "Think, Polydamas, andtell me truly whether this man is not as well worth killing asProthoenor was: he seems rich, and of rich family, a brother, it maybe, or son of the knight Antenor, for he is very like him."

　　But he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.Acamas then bestrode his brother's body and wounded Promachus theBoeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother'sbody away. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, "Argive archers,braggarts that you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only,but some of you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See howPromachus now sleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother'sblood has not long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankfulif he leaves a kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall."

　　His taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enragedthan any of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not standhis ground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-masterPhorbas, whom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealththan any other of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleosnow wounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ballfrom its socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape ofthe neck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him.Peneleos then drew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that bothhead and helmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spearstill sticking in the eye; he then held up the head, as though ithad been a poppy-head, and showed it to the Trojans, vaunting overthem as he did so. "Trojans," he cried, "bid the father and motherof noble Ilioneus make moan for him in their house, for the wifealso of Promachus son of Alegenor will never be gladdened by thecoming of her dear husband- when we Argives return with our ships fromTroy."

　　As he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about tosee whither he might fly for safety.

　　Tell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of theArgives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of theearthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon wasfirst to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.Antilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morysand Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The sonof Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank,and the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in amongthem; on this his life came hurrying out of him at the place wherehe had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son ofOileus killed more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as heto pursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.

　　BOOK XV

　　BUT when their flight had taken them past the trench and the setstakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojansmade a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear.Jove now woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying withgolden-throned Juno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw theTrojans and Achaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the othersdriving them pell-mell before them with King Neptune in their midst.He saw Hector lying on the ground with his comrades gathered roundhim, gasping for breath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, forit was not the feeblest of the Achaeans who struck him.

　　The sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely onJuno. "I see, Juno," said he, "you mischief- making trickster, thatyour cunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the routof his host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you willbe the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you notremember how once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened twoanvils on to your feet, and bound your hands in a chain of goldwhich none might break, and you hung in mid-air among the clouds.All the gods in Olympus were in a fury, but they could not reach youto set you free; when I caught any one of them I gripped him andhurled him from the heavenly threshold till he came fainting down toearth; yet even this did not relieve my mind from the incessantanxiety which I felt about noble Hercules whom you and Boreas hadspitefully conveyed beyond the seas to Cos, after suborning thetempests; but I rescued him, and notwithstanding all his mightylabours I brought him back again to Argos. I would remind you ofthis that you may learn to leave off being so deceitful, anddiscover how much you are likely to gain by the embraces out ofwhich you have come here to trick me."

　　Juno trembled as he spoke, and said, "May heaven above and earthbelow be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx- and thisis the most solemn oath that a blessed god can take- nay, I swear alsoby your own almighty head and by our bridal bed- things over which Icould never possibly perjure myself- that Neptune is not punishingHector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing ofmine; it is all of his own mere motion because he was sorry to see theAchaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him, I shouldtell him to do as you bid him."

　　The sire of gods and men smiled and answered, "If you, Juno, werealways to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune, likeit or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking. If,then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among therank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the bow,that I want them- Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and tellNeptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he maysend Hector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he willthus forget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back inconfusion till they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus.Achilles will then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, andHector will kill him in front of Ilius after he has slain manywarriors, and among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will killHector to avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it aboutthat the Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back tillthey fulfil the counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will notstay my anger, nor permit any god to help the Danaans till I haveaccomplished the desire of the son of Peleus, according to the promiseI made by bowing my head on the day when Thetis touched my knees andbesought me to give him honour."

　　Juno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to greatOlympus. Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vastcontinents, and he says to himself, "Now I will be here, or there,"and he would have all manner of things- even so swiftly did Junowing her way till she came to high Olympus and went in among thegods who were gathered in the house of Jove. When they saw her theyall of them came up to her, and held out their cups to her by way ofgreeting. She let the others be, but took the cup offered her bylovely Themis, who was first to come running up to her. "Juno," saidshe, "why are you here? And you seem troubled- has your husband theson of Saturn been frightening you?"

　　And Juno answered, "Themis, do not ask me about it. You know whata proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods totable, where you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designswhich he has avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will beangered by them, however peaceably he may be feasting now."

　　On this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout thehouse of Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed withcare, and she spoke up in a rage. "Fools that we are," she cried,"to be thus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up tohim and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof andcares for nobody, for he knows that he is much stronger than any otherof the immortals. Make the best, therefore, of whatever ills he maychoose to send each one of you; Mars, I take it, has had a taste ofthem already, for his son Ascalaphus has fallen in battle- the manwhom of all others he loved most dearly and whose father he ownshimself to be."

　　When he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat ofhis hands, and said in anger, "Do not blame me, you gods that dwell inheaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death ofmy son, even though it end in my being struck by Jove's lightningand lying in blood and dust among the corpses."

　　As he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout,while he put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused tostill more fierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals,had not Minerva, ararmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from herseat and hurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and theshield from his shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from hisstrong hand and set it on one side; then she said to Mars, "Madman,you are undone; you have ears that hear not, or you have lost alljudgement and understanding; have you not heard what Juno has saidon coming straight from the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wishto go through all kinds of suffering before you are brought backsick and sorry to Olympus, after having caused infinite mischief toall us others? Jove would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeansto themselves; he would come to Olympus to punish us, and would gripus up one after another, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay asideyour anger for the death of your son; better men than he have eitherbeen killed already or will fall hereafter, and one cannot protectevery one's whole family."

　　With these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Junocalled Apollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. "Jove,"she said to them, "desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; whenyou have seen him you are to do as he may then bid you."

　　Thereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris andApollo made all haste on their way. When they reachedmany-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seatedon topmost Gargarus with a fragrant cloud encircling his head aswith a diadem. They stood before his presence, and he was pleased withthem for having been so quick in obeying the orders his wife had giventhem.

　　He spoke to Iris first. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, tell KingNeptune what I now bid you- and tell him true. Bid him leave offfighting, and either join the company of the gods, or go down into thesea. If he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider wellwhether he is strong enough to hold his own against me if I attackhim. I am older and much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraidto set himself up as on a level with myself, of whom all the othergods stand in awe."

　　Iris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail orsnowflakes that fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas,even so did she wing her way till she came close up to the greatshaker of the earth. Then she said, "I have come, O dark-haired kingthat holds the world in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove.He bids you leave off fighting, and either join the company of thegods or go down into the sea; if, however, you take no heed anddisobey him, he says he will come down here and fight you. He wouldhave you keep out of his reach, for he is older and much stronger thanyou are, and yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as on a levelwith himself, of whom all the other gods stand in awe."

　　Neptune was very angry and said, "Great heavens! strong as Jovemay be, he has said more than he can do if he has threatenedviolence against me, who am of like honour with himself. We were threebrothers whom Rhea bore to Saturn- Jove, myself, and Hades who rulesthe world below. Heaven and earth were divided into three parts, andeach of us was to have an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell tome to have my dwelling in the sea for evermore; Hades took thedarkness of the realms under the earth, while air and sky and cloudswere the portion that fell to Jove; but earth and great Olympus arethe common property of all. Therefore I will not walk as Jove wouldhave me. For all his strength, let him keep to his own third share andbe contented without threatening to lay hands upon me as though I werenobody. Let him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters,who must perforce obey him.

　　Iris fleet as the wind then answered, "Am I really, Neptune, to takethis daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsideryour answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know thatthe Erinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person."

　　Neptune answered, "Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken inseason. It is well when a messenger shows so much discretion.Nevertheless it cuts me to the very heart that any one should rebukeso angrily another who is his own peer, and of like empire withhimself. Now, however, I will give way in spite of my displeasure;furthermore let me tell you, and I mean what I say- if contrary to thedesire of myself, Minerva driver of the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and KingVulcan, Jove spares steep Ilius, and will not let the Achaeans havethe great triumph of sacking it, let him understand that he will incurour implacable resentment."

　　Neptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorelydid the Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, "Go, dearPhoebus, to Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace hasnow gone down under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure.Had he not done so those gods who are below with Saturn would havecome to hear of the fight between us. It is better for both of us thathe should have curbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for I shouldhave had much trouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis,and shake it furiously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic;take, moreover, brave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, androuse him to deeds of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying backto their ships and to the Hellespont. From that point I will thinkit well over, how the Achaeans may have a respite from theirtroubles."

　　Apollo obeyed his father's saying, and left the crests of Ida,flying like a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. Hefound Hector no longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for hehad just come to himself again. He knew those who were about him,and the sweat and hard breathing had left him from the moment when thewill of aegis-bearing Jove had revived him. Apollo stood beside himand said, "Hector, son of Priam, why are you so faint, and why are youhere away from the others? Has any mishap befallen you?"

　　Hector in a weak voice answered, "And which, kind sir, of the godsare you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me onthe chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships ofthe Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure thatthis very day I should breathe my last and go down into the house ofHades."

　　Then King Apollo said to him, "Take heart; the son of Saturn hassent you a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, evenme, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardianhitherto not only of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore,order your horsemen to drive their chariots to the ships in greatmultitudes. I will go before your horses to smooth the way for them,and will turn the Achaeans in flight."

　　As he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of hispeople. And as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallopsgloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to take hisbath in the river- he tosses his head, and his mane streams over hisshoulders as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed tothe pastures where the mares are feeding- even so Hector, when heheard what the god said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward asfast as his limbs could take him. As country peasants set their houndson to a homed stag or wild goat- he has taken shelter under rock orthicket, and they cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whomtheir shouts have roused stands in their path, and they are in nofurther humour for the chase- even so the Achaeans were still chargingon in a body, using their swords and spears pointed at both ends,but when they saw Hector going about among his men they were afraid,and their hearts fell down into their feet.

　　Then spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a manwho could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided. Hethen with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: "What, inheaven's name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again?Every one made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, butit seems that one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killedmany of us Danaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the handof Jove must be with him or he would never dare show himself somasterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us alldo as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall backupon the ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower ofthe army stand firm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back at thepoint of our spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive that hewill then think better of it before he tries to charge into thepress of the Danaans."

　　Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those whowere about Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover ofTeucer, Meriones, and Meges peer of Mars called all their best menabout them and sustained the fight against Hector and the Trojans, butthe main body fell back upon the ships of the Achaeans.

　　The Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding onat their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloudabout his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with itsshaggy fringe, which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to striketerror into the hearts of men. With this in his hand he led on theTrojans.

　　The Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry ofbattle rose high from either side, and the arrows flew from thebowstrings. Many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in thebodies of many a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway,before they could taste of man's fair flesh and glut themselves withblood. So long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and withoutshaking it, the weapons on either side took effect and the peoplefell, but when he shook it straight in the face of the Danaans andraised his mighty battle-cry their hearts fainted within them and theyforgot their former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in thedead of night on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when theherdsman is not there- even so were the Danaans struck helpless, forApollo filled them with panic and gave victory to Hector and theTrojans.

　　The fight then became more scattered and they killed one anotherwhere they best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one,leader of the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade ofMenestheus. Aeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard sonto Oileus, and brother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away fromhis own country, for he had killed a man, a kinsman of hisstepmother Eriopis whom Oileus had married. Iasus had become aleader of the Athenians, and was son of Sphelus the son of Boucolos.Polydamas killed Mecisteus, and Polites Echius, in the front of thebattle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris struck Deiochus from behindin the lower part of the shoulder, as he was flying among theforemost, and the point of the spear went clean through him.

　　While they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, theAchaeans were flying pellmell to the trench and the set stakes, andwere forced back within their wall. Hector then cried out to theTrojans, "Forward to the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see anyman keeping back on the other side the wall away from the ships I willhave him killed: his kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his duesof fire, but dogs shall tear him in pieces in front of our city."

　　As he spoke he laid his whip about his horses' shoulders andcalled to the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted witha cry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck withhis own. Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the banks ofthe deep trench into its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, asbroad as the throw of a spear when a man is trying his strength. TheTrojan battalions poured over the bridge, and Apollo with hisredoubtable aegis led the way. He kicked down the wall of the Achaeansas easily as a child who playing on the sea-shore has built a house ofsand and then kicks it down again and destroys it- even so did you,O Apollo, shed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them withpanic and confusion.

　　Thus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out toone another and raising their hands with loud cries every man toheaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted uphis hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more ferventlythan any of them. "Father Jove," said he, "if ever any one inwheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heiferand prayed that he might return safely home, whereon you bowed yourhead to him in assent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojansto triumph thus over the Achaeans."

　　All counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to die prayer of theaged son of Neleus. When the heard Jove thunder they flungthemselves yet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breakingover the bulwarks of a ship when the sea runs high before a gale-for it is the force of the wind that makes the waves so great- even sodid the Trojans spring over the wall with a shout, and drive theirchariots onwards. The two sides fought with their double-pointedspears in hand-to-hand encounter-the Trojans from their chariots,and the Achaeans climbing up into their ships and wielding the longpikes that were lying on the decks ready for use in a sea-fight,jointed and shod with bronze.

　　Now Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fightingabout the wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships,remained sitting in the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining himwith his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease hispain. When, however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the breach inthe wall, while the Achaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, hecried aloud, and smote his two thighs with the flat of his hands."Eurypylus," said he in his dismay, "I know you want me badly, but Icannot stay with you any longer, for there is hard fighting goingon; a servant shall take care of you now, for I must make all speed toAchilles, and induce him to fight if I can; who knows but withheaven's help I may persuade him. A man does well to listen to theadvice of a friend."

　　When he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm andresisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer innumber, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither couldthe Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among thetents and ships. As a carpenter's line gives a true edge to a piece ofship's timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva hasinstructed in all kinds of useful arts- even so level was the issue ofthe fight between the two sides, as they fought some round one andsome round another.

　　Hector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about thesame ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor yetcould Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought him.

　　Then Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear ashe was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the groundand the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallenin front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a jot,but rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of hisarmour now that he has fallen."

　　He then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hitLycophron a follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was livingwith Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans.Hector's spear struck him on the head below the ear, and he fellheadlong from the ship's prow on to the ground with no life left inhim. Ajax shook with rage and said to his brother, "Teucer, my goodfellow, our trusty comrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came tolive with us from Cythera and whom we honoured as much as our ownparents. Hector has just killed him; fetch your deadly arrows atonce and the bow which Phoebus Apollo gave you."

　　Teucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver inhis hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and hitCleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son ofPanthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to hishorses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,doing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now comeupon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avertit, for the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from hischariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside. KingPolydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up to thehorses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon, andordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He thenwent back and took his place in the front ranks.

　　Teucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have beenno more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him thenand there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyeson Teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking hisbowstring for him just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim;on this the arrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands.Teucer shook with anger and said to his brother, "Alas, see how heaventhwarts us in all we do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched thebow from my hand, though I strung it this selfsame morning that itmight serve me for many an arrow."

　　Ajax son of Telamon answered, "My good fellow, let your bow and yourarrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite theDanaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and bothfight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may besuccessful for the moment but if we fight as we ought they will findit a hard matter to take the ships."

　　Teucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shieldfour hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he sethis helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that noddedmenacingly above it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, andforthwith he was by the side of Ajax.

　　When Hector saw that Teucer's bow was of no more use to him, heshouted out to the Trojans and Lycians, "Trojans, Lycians, andDardanians good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show yourmettle here at the ships, for I see the weapon of one of theirchieftains made useless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see whenJove is helping people and means to help them still further, oragain when he is bringing them down and will do nothing for them; heis now on our side, and is going against the Argives. Thereforeswarm round the ships and fight. If any of you is struck by spear orsword and loses his life, let him die; he dies with honour who diesfighting for his country; and he will leave his wife and children safebehind him, with his house and allotment unplundered if only theAchaeans can be driven back to their own land, they and their ships."

　　With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on theother side exhorted his comrades saying, "Shame on you Argives, we arenow utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving theenemy from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that youwill be able to get home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on hiswhole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them remember that theyare not at a dance but in battle? Our only course is to fight themwith might and main; we had better chance it, life or death, oncefor all, than fight long and without issue hemmed in at our ships byworse men than ourselves."

　　With these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector thenkilled Schedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajaxkilled Laodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamaskilled Otus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief ofthe proud Epeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, butPolydamas crouched down, and he missed him, for Apollo would notsuffer the son of Panthous to fall in battle; but the spear hitCroesmus in the middle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to theground, and Meges stripped him of his armour. At that moment thevaliant soldier Dolops son of Lampus sprang upon Lampus was son ofLaomedon and for his valour, while his son Dolops was versed in allthe ways of war. He then struck the middle of the son of Phyleus'shield with his spear, setting on him at close quarters, but hisgood corslet made with plates of metal saved him; Phyleus hadbrought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where his host, KingEuphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect him. It nowserved to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck the topmostcrest of Dolops's bronze helmet with his spear and tore away its plumeof horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet as it was ittumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting andconfident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got by theside of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder,from behind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into hischest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him tostrip him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers forhelp, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon,who erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before thewar broke out; but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went back toIlius, where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priamwho treated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him andsaid, "Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note of thedeath of your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying totake Dolops's armour? Follow me; there must be no fighting the Argivesfrom a distance now, but we must do so in close combat till eitherwe kill them or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her people."

　　He led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after.Meanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. "Myfriends," he cried, "be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves inbattle so as to win respect from one another. Men who respect eachother's good opinion are less likely to be killed than those who donot, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory."

　　Thus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back theTrojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with awall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of theloud battle-cry urged Antilochus on. "Antilochus," said he, "you areyoung and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or morevaliant than you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan andkill him."

　　He hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at oncedarted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after lookingcarefully round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dartdid not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippusthe proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was comingforward, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavilyto the ground. Antilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawnwhich a hunter has hit as it was breaking away from its covert, andkilled it. Even so, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus springupon you to strip you of your armour; but noble Hector marked him, andcame running up to him through the thick of the battle. Antilochus,brave soldier though he was, would not stay to face him, but fled likesome savage creature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when ithas killed a dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a bodyof men can be gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestorfly, and the Trojans and Hector with a cry that rent the airshowered their weapons after him; nor did he turn round and stay hisflight till he had reached his comrades.

　　The Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards theships in fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them onto new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argivesand defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant givingglory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon theships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis hadmade him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he should see the glareof a blazing ship. From that hour he was about so to order that theTrojans should be driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory tothe Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam, whowas cager enough already, to assail the ships. His fury was as that ofMars, or as when a fire is raging in the glades of some dense forestupon the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared underhis terrible eye-brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples byreason of the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was withhim, and though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victoryand glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already PallasMinerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands ofthe son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to break the ranksof the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in the goodliestarmour; but do what he might he could not break through them, for theystood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff rising from thegrey sea that braves the anger of the gale, and of the waves thatthunder up against it. He fell upon them like flames of fire fromevery quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high by wind and storm,breaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roaragainst the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, andthey are saved but by a very little from destruction- even so were thehearts of the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lionattacking a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in thelow-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore- the herdsman is at hiswit's end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now in the vanand now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion springs into thethick of them and fastens on a cow so that they all tremble forfear- even so were the Achaeans utterly panic-stricken by Hector andfather Jove. Nevertheless Hector only killed Periphetes of Mycenae; hewas son of Copreus who was wont to take the orders of KingEurystheus to mighty Hercules, but the son was a far better man thanthe father in every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior,and in understanding ranked among the foremost men of Mycenae. He itwas who then afforded Hector a triumph, for as he was turning backhe stumbled against the rim of his shield which reached his feet,and served to keep the javelins off him. He tripped against this andfell face upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as he didso. Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a spear intohis chest, and killed him close to his own comrades. These, for alltheir sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves terriblyafraid of Hector.

　　They had now reached the ships and the prows of those that hadbeen drawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans camepouring after them. The Argives were driven back from the first row ofships, but they made a stand by their tents without being broken upand scattered; shame and fear restrained them. They kept shoutingincessantly to one another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength tothe Achaeans, was loudest in imploring every man by his parents, andbeseeching him to stand firm.

　　"Be men, my friends," he cried, "and respect one another's goodopinion. Think, all of you, on your children, your wives, yourproperty, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On theirbehalf though they are not here, I implore you to stand firm, andnot to turn in flight."

　　With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva liftedthe thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell uponthem, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight wasraging. They could see Hector and all his men, both those in therear who were taking no part in the battle, and those who werefighting by the ships.

　　Ajax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, butstrode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelvecubits long and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats ofhorsemanship couples four horses together and comes tearing full speedalong the public way from the country into some large town- manyboth men and women marvel as they see him for he keeps all the timechanging his horse, springing from one to another without ever missinghis feet while the horses are at a gallop- even so did Ajax gostriding from one ship's deck to another, and his voice went up intothe heavens. He kept on shouting his orders to the Danaans andexhorting them to defend their ships and tents; neither did Hectorremain within the main body of the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagleswoops down upon a flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river-geese, itmay be, or cranes, or long-necked swans- even so did Hector makestraight for a dark-prowed ship, rushing right towards it; for Jovewith his mighty hand impelled him forward, and roused his people tofollow him.

　　And now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You wouldhave thought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercelydid they fight; and this was the mind in which they were- the Achaeansdid not believe they should escape destruction but thoughtthemselves doomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beathigh with the hope of firing the ships and putting the Achaeanheroes to the sword.

　　Thus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern ofthe good ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore himback to his native land. Round this ship there raged a closehand-to-hand fight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fightat a distance with bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked atone another in close combat with their mighty swords and spearspointed at both ends; they fought moreover with keen battle-axes andwith hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted and scabbarded withiron, fell from hand or shoulder as they fought, and the earth ran redwith blood. Hector, when he had seized the ship, would not loose hishold but held on to its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans,"Bring fire, and raise the battle-cry all of you with a singlevoice. Now has Jove vouchsafed us a day that will pay us for all therest; this day we shall take the ships which came hither againstheaven's will, and which have caused us such infinite sufferingthrough the cowardice of our councillors, who when I would have donebattle at the ships held me back and forbade the host to follow me; ifJove did then indeed warp our judgements, himself now commands meand cheers me on."

　　As he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on theAchaeans, and Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome bythe darts that were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed.Therefore he left the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on tothe seven-foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out,and with his spear held back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to theships. All the time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice andexhorting the Danaans. "My friends," he cried, "Danaan heroes,servants of Mars, be men my friends, and fight with might and withmain. Can we hope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield usmore surely than the one we have? There is no strong city withinreach, whence we may draw fresh forces to turn the scales in ourfavour. We are on the plain of the armed Trojans with the sea behindus, and far from our own country. Our salvation, therefore, is inthe might of our hands and in hard fighting."

　　As he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and whenany Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector's bidding, hewould be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his longspear. Twelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before theships.

　　BOOK XVI

　　THUS did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclusdrew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from somespring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice.When Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said,"Why, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child thatcomes running to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried-she catches hold of her mother's dress to stay her though she is ina hurry, and looks tearfully up until her mother carries her- evensuch tears, Patroclus, are you now shedding. Have you anything tosay to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthiawhich you alone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is stillalive, as also Peleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons- men whoseloss we two should bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about theArgives and the way in which they are being killed at the ships, throutheir own high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell methat both of us may know about it."

　　Then, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered,"Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not beangry, but I weep for the disaster that has now befallen theArgives. All those who have been their champions so far are lying atthe ships, wounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus hasbeen hit with a spear, while famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have receivedsword-wounds; Eurypylus again has been struck with an arrow in thethigh; skilled apothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healingthem of their wounds; are you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May itnever be my lot to nurse such a passion as you have done, to thebaning of your own good name. Who in future story will speak well ofyou unless you now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity;knight Peleus was not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the greysea bore you and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel andremorseless are you. If however you are kept back through knowledge ofsome oracle, or if your mother Thetis has told you something fromthe mouth of Jove, at least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if Imay bring deliverance to the Danaans. Let me moreover wear yourarmour; the Trojans may thus mistake me for you and quit the field, sothat the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have breathing time-which while they are fighting may hardly be. We who are fresh mightsoon drive tired men back from our ships and tents to their own city."

　　He knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his owndestruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, "What, noblePatroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I amheeding, nor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove,but I am cut to the very heart that one of my own rank should dareto rob me because he is more powerful than I am. This, after allthat I have gone through, is more than I can endure. The girl whom thesons of the Achaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spearon having sacked a city- her has King Agamemnon taken from me asthough I were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: noman may keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till battleand the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird myarmour about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for thedark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet; theArgives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow space,and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out againstthem, because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming nearthem. Had they seen this, there would not have been a creek nor gripthat had not been filled with their dead as they fled back again.And so it would have been, if only King Agamemnon had dealt fairlyby me. As it is the Trojans have beset our host. Diomed son ofTydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the Danaans, neitherhave I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hatedhead, whereas that of murderous Hector rings in my cars as he givesorders to the Trojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill thewhole plain with their cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fallupon them and save the fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and preventus from being able to return. Do, however, as I now bid you, thatyou may win me great honour from all the Danaans, and that they mayrestore the girl to me again and give me rich gifts into thebargain. When you have driven the Trojans from the ships, come backagain. Though Juno's thundering husband should put triumph within yourreach, do not fight the Trojans further in my absence, or you will robme of glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of battle go onkilling the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of theever-living gods from Olympus attack you- for Phoebus Apollo lovesthem well: return when you have freed the ships from peril, and letothers wage war upon the plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, andApollo, that not a single man of all the Trojans might be leftalive, nor yet of the Argives, but that we two might be alone leftto tear aside the mantle that veils the brow of Troy."

　　Thus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground forthe shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and thejavelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamedabout his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missilesthat kept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protectedhis face. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held hisshield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, theycould not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, thesweat rained from every pore of his body, he had not a moment'srespite, and on all sides he was beset by danger upon danger.

　　And now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, howfire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close upand let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. Hecut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened on to theshaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headlessspear, while the bronze point flew some way off and came ringingdown on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this, and wasdismayed at seeing that Jove had now left him utterly defencelessand was willing victory for the Trojans. Therefore he drew back, andthe Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped inflame.

　　The fire was now flaring about the ship's stern, whereon Achillessmote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, "Up, noble knight, for Isee the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroyour ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on yourarmour at once while I call our people together."

　　As he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legswith greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver;after this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaidand studded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about hisshoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set hishelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that noddedmenacingly above it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited hishands, but he did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout andstrong, for none other of the Achaeans could wield it, though Achillescould do so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion,which Chiron had cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus,wherewith to deal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke hishorses with all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honournext after Achilles, and on whose support in battle he could rely mostfirmly. Automedon therefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius,steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom the harpyPodarge bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by thewaters of the river Oceanus. In the side traces he set the noble horsePedasus, whom Achilles had brought away with him when he sacked thecity of Eetion, and who, mortal steed though he was, could take hisplace along with those that were immortal.

　　Meanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and badehis Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves thatare feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon themountains, and their jaws are red with blood- they go in a pack to lapwater from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and theyreek of blood and slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it ishunger drives them- even so did the leaders and counsellors of theMyrmidons gather round the good squire of the fleet descendant ofAeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both men andhorses.

　　Fifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each therewas a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom hecould trust, while he was himself commander over them all.Menesthius of the gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius thatstreams from heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair Polydoradaughter of Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheius- a womanmated with a god- but he was called son of Borus son of Perieres, withwhom his mother was living as his wedded wife, and who gave greatwealth to gain her. The second company was led by noble Eudorus, sonto an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas the gracefuldancer, bore him; the mighty slayer of Argos was enamoured of her ashe saw her among the singing women at a dance held in honour ofDiana the rushing huntress of the golden arrows; he therefore-Mercury, giver of all good- went with her into an upper chamber, andlay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble son Eudorus,singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. When Ilithuia goddessof the pains of child-birth brought him to the light of day, and hesaw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles son of Actor took themother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain her, but her fatherPhylas brought the child up, and took care of him, doting as fondlyupon him as though he were his own son. The third company was led byPisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman among all theMyrmidons next to Achilles' own comrade Patroclus. The old knightPhoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon, noble son ofLaerceus of the fifth.

　　When Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all withtheir captains, he charged them straitly saying, "Myrmidons,remember your threats against the Trojans while you were at theships in the time of my anger, and you were all complaining of me.'Cruel son of Peleus,' you would say, 'your mother must have suckledyou on gall, so ruthless are you. You keep us here at the shipsagainst our will; if you are so relentless it were better we went homeover the sea.' Often have you gathered and thus chided with me. Thehour is now come for those high feats of arms that you have so longbeen pining for, therefore keep high hearts each one of you to dobattle with the Trojans."

　　With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and theyserried their companies yet more closely when they heard the oftheir king. As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of somehigh house which is to give shelter from the winds- even so closelywere the helmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shieldpressed on shield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were theythat the horse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmetstouched each other as they bent their heads.

　　In front of them all two men put on their armour- Patroclus andAutomedon- two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. ThenAchilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chestwhich silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board ship, andwhich she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, andgood thick rugs. In this chest he had a cup of rare workmanship,from which no man but himself might drink, nor would he makeoffering from it to any other god save only to father Jove. He tookthe cup from the chest and cleansed it with sulphur; this done herinsed it clean water, and after he had washed his hands he drew wine.Then he stood in the middle of the court and prayed, looking towardsheaven, and making his drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen ofJove whose joy is in thunder. "King Jove," he cried, "lord ofDodona, god of the Pelasgi, who dwellest afar, you who hold wintryDodona in your sway, where your prophets the Selli dwell around youwith their feet unwashed and their couches made upon the ground- ifyou heard me when I prayed to you aforetime, and did me honour whileyou sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe me now the fulfilmentof yet this further prayer. I shall stay here where my ships arelying, but I shall send my comrade into battle at the head of manyMyrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory may go with him; putyour courage into his heart that Hector may learn whether my squire isman enough to fight alone, or whether his might is only then soindomitable when I myself enter the turmoil of war. Afterwards when hehas chased the fight and the cry of battle from the ships, grantthat he may return unharmed, with his armour and his comrades,fighters in close combat."

　　Thus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part ofit he did indeed vouchsafe him- but not the whole. He granted thatPatroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, butrefused to let him come safely out of the fight.

　　When he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilleswent inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.

　　Then he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fiercefight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans.

　　Meanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on tillthey sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out likewasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love totease, whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung- oragain, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident,every wasp will come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones-even with such rage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from theirships, and their cry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus calledout to his men at the top of his voice, "Myrmidons, followers ofAchilles son of Peleus, be men my friends, fight with might and withmain, that we may win glory for the son of Peleus, who is far theforemost man at the ships of the Argives- he, and his close fightingfollowers. The son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn hisfolly in showing no respect to the bravest of the Achaeans."

　　With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and theyfell in a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the crywhich the Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son ofMenoetius and his squire all gleaming in their armour, they weredaunted and their battalions were thrown into confusion, for theythought the fleet son of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, andhave been reconciled to Agamemnon; every one, therefore, lookedround about to see whither he might fly for safety.

　　Patroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where menwere packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus.He hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydonand the broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on theright shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; onthis his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing theirleader, who was the finest soldier among them, Patroclus struckpanic into them all. He thus drove them from the ship and quenched thefire that was then blazing- leaving the half-burnt ship to lie whereit was. The Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent theskies, while the Danaans poured after them from their ships,shouting also without ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of thethunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some loftymountain, and all the peaks, the jutting headlands, and forestglades show out in the great light that flashes from the burstingheavens, even so when the Danaans had now driven back the fire fromtheir ships, they took breath for a little while; but the fury ofthe fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were not driven back inutter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted from their groundonly by sheer fighting.

　　The fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killedone another when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetiusfirst drove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he wasturning round; the point went clean through, and broke the bone sothat he fell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest,where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. Theson of Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he coulddo so took aim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles arethicker than in any other part; the spear tore through all thesinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sonsof Nestor one, Antilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point ofthe spear through his throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang onAntilochus in hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrodethe body spear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him,and in a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal hisblow; his aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at theroot of his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fellheavily to the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus didthese two noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain by thetwo sons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of Amisodorus, whohad reared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. Ajax son ofOileus sprang on Cleobulus and took him alive as he was entangled inthe crush; but he killed him then and there by a sword-blow on theneck. The sword reeked with his blood, while dark death and the stronghand of fate gripped him and closed his eyes.

　　Peneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missedeach other with their spears. They had both thrown without effect,so now they drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest ofPeneleos' helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smoteLycon on the neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that thehead was held on by nothing but the skin, and there was no more lifeleft in him. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on foot and caught him upjust as he was about to mount his chariot; he drove a spear throughhis right shoulder so that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyeswere closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; thebronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the brain,crashing in among the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth wereall of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream fromboth his eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils,and the darkness of death enfolded him round about.

　　Thus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill hisman. As ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them whenthey are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flockthrough the carelessness of the shepherd- and when the wolves see thisthey pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves-even so did the Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled withill-omened cries in their panic and had no more fight left in them.

　　Meanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector,but Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders wellunder cover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for thewhizzing of the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He wellknew that the fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood hisground and tried to protect his comrades.

　　As when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of aclear sky when Jove is brewing a gale- even with such panic strickenrout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going.Hector's fleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and heleft the Trojan host penned in by the deep trench against theirwill. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots inthe trench and left their master's car behind them. Patroclus gavechase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against theTrojans, who, being now no longer in a body, filled all the wayswith their cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened with theclouds of dust they raised, and the horses strained every nerve intheir flight from the tents and ships towards the city.

　　Patroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flyingin confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were beingsmashed in all directions, and many a man came tumbling down fromhis own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whoseimmortal steeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trenchat a bound as they sped onward. He was intent on trying to get nearHector, for he had set his heart on spearing him, but Hector'shorses were now hurrying him away. As the whole dark earth bows beforesome tempest on an autumn day when Jove rains his hardest to punishmen for giving crooked judgement in their courts, and arriving justicetherefrom without heed to the decrees of heaven- all the rivers runfull and the torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlongfrom the mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works ofmen- even such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in theirflight.

　　Patroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him anddrove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reachthe city, but he would not Yet them, and bore down on them between theriver and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he thenavenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it wasexposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground.Next he sprang on Thestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled upin his chariot, for he had lost his head and the reins had been tornout of his hands. Patroclus went up to him and drove a spear intohis right jaw; he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear pulledhim over the rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of somejutting rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook anda line- even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping from hischariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while falling.On this, as Erylaus was on to attack him, he struck him full on thehead with a stone, and his brains were all battered inside his helmet,whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of death tookhold upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas,Amphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris,lpheus, Euippus and Polymelus son of Argeas.

　　Now when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,being overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycianssaying. "Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle; Iwill myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is somasterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a braveman upon the ground."

　　He sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he sawthis, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one anotherwith loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that screamand tear at one another in some high mountain fastness.

　　The son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said toJuno who was his wife and sister, "Alas, that it should be the lotof Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand ofPatroclus. I am in two minds whether to catch him up out of thefight and set him down safe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, orto let him now fall by the hand of the son of Menoetius."

　　And Juno answered, "Most dread son of Saturn, what is this thatyou are saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has longbeen fated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall notall of us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to yourheart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other ofthe gods will be also wanting to escort his son out of battle, forthere are many sons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and youwill make every one jealous. If, however, you are fond of him and pityhim, let him indeed fall by the hand of Patroclus, but as soon asthe life is gone out of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear himoff the field and take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where hisbrothers and his kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in duehonour to the dead."

　　The sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of bloodupon the earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to killon the rich plain of Troy far from his home.

　　When they were now come close to one another Patroclus struckThrasydemus, the brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of thebelly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus andmissed him, but he struck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, andit screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the lifewent out of it. The other two horses began to plunge; the pole ofthe chariot cracked and they got entangled in the reins through thefall of the horse that was yoked along with them; but Automedon knewwhat to do; without the loss of a moment he drew the keen blade thathung by his sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon theother two righted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again wenttogether into battle.

　　Sarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him,the point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hittinghim. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from hishand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds theever-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or tallpine to which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains tomake timber for ship-building- even so did he lie stretched at fulllength in front of his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching atthe blood-stained dust. As when a lion springs with a bound upon aherd of cattle and fastens on a great black bull which diesbellowing in its clutches- even so did the leader of the Lycianwarriors struggle in death as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. Hecalled on his trusty comrade and said, "Glaucus, my brother, heroamong heroes, put forth all your strength, fight with might andmain, now if ever quit yourself like a valiant soldier. First go aboutamong the Lycian captains and bid them fight for Sarpedon; thenyourself also do battle to save my armour from being taken. My namewill haunt you henceforth and for ever if the Achaeans rob me of myarmour now that I have fallen at their ships. Do your very utmostand call all my people together."

　　Death closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on hisbreast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came outalong with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon's soul atthe same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds, whowere wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.

　　Glaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said,for he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his otherhand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer's arrow hadgiven him when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, wasassailing it. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying,"Hear me O king from your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, ormay be in Troy, for in all places you can hear the prayer of one whois in distress, as I now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand isaching with pain, there is no staunching the blood, and my whole armdrags by reason of my hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor goamong my foes and fight them, thou our prince, Jove's son Sarpedon, isslain. Jove defended not his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal meof my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on theLycians and to fight along with them round the body of him who hasfallen."

　　Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,staunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.Glaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god hadanswered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lyciancaptains, and bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. Fromthese he strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthousand Agenor; he then went in search of Aeneas and Hector, and when hehad found them he said, "Hector, you have utterly forgotten yourallies, who languish here for your sake far from friends and homewhile you do nothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycianwarriors has fallen- he who was at once the right and might ofLycia; Mars has laid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand byhim, my friends, and suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of hisarmour, nor to treat his body with contumely in revenge for all theDanaans whom we have speared at the ships."

　　As he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernablegrief; for Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the mainstays of their city, both as having much people with him, andhimself the foremost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriatedby the fall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans withall their might, while the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son ofMenoetius cheered on the Achaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes,men who needed no bidding. "Ajaxes," said he, "may it now please youto show youselves the men you have always been, or even better-Sarpedon is fallen- he who was first to overleap the wall of theAchaeans; let us take the body and outrage it; let us strip the armourfrom his shoulders, and kill his comrades if they try to rescue hisbody."

　　He spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,therefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and theMyrmidons and Achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions,and fought desperately about the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercelythe while. Mighty was the din of their armour as they came together,and Jove shed a thick darkness over the fight, to increase the ofthe battle over the body of his son.

　　At first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for oneof the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of nobleAgacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; butpresently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he tookrefuge with Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noblesteeds to fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him onthe head with a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, andhis brains inside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fellface foremost upon the body of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus wasenraged by the death of his comrade, and sped through the frontranks as swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws orstarlings. Even so swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, did you makestraight for the Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwithhe struck Sthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone,and broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On thisHector and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a mancan throw a javelin when competing for some prize, or even inbattle- so far did the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans.Glaucus, captain of the Lycians, was the first to rally them, bykilling Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived in Hellas and was therichest man among the Myrmidons. Glaucus turned round suddenly, justas Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him, anddrove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fellheavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a man filled theAchaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were exultant, and came upin a body round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful oftheir prowess, bore straight down upon them.

　　Meriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus sonof Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured bythe people as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under thejaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the darkness of deathlaid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping tohit him under the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw itcoming and stooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew pasthim and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went onquivering till Mars robbed it of its force. The spear, therefore, spedfrom Aeneas's hand in vain and fell quivering to the ground. Aeneaswas angry and said, "Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if I had hityou my spear would soon have made an end of you."

　　And Meriones answered, "Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will notbe able to make an end of every one who comes against you. You areonly a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle ofyour shield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you maybe, I should soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life to Hadesof the noble steeds."

　　On this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, "Meriones, herothough you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my goodfriend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; someof them must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words forcouncil; fight, therefore, and say nothing."

　　He led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. Asthe sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains-and the thud of their axes is heard afar- even such a din now rosefrom earth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, asmen smote each other with their swords and spears pointed at bothends. A man had need of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so coveredwas he from head to foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmedabout the body, as flies that buzz round the full milk-pails in springwhen they are brimming with milk- even so did they gather roundSarpedon; nor did Jove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from thefight, but kept looking at it all the time, for he was settling howbest to kill Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should beallowed to end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, andstrip him of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet furthertrouble to the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the bravesquire of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojansback towards the city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, hemade Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot andfled, bidding the other Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scalesof Jove had turned against him. Neither would the brave Lyciansstand firm; they were dismayed when they saw their king lying struckto the heart amid a heap of corpses- for when the son of Saturn madethe fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The Achaeans, thereforestripped the gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son ofMenoetius gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Jove lord ofthe storm-cloud said to Apollo, "Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, andtake Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black bloodfrom off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may washhim in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortalraiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two fleetmessengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him straightway to therich land of Lycia, where his brothers and kinsmen will inter him, andwill raise both mound and pillar to his memory, in due honour to thedead."

　　Thus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father's saying, and came down fromthe heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he tookSarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long wayoff, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosiaand clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him tothe arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, whopresently set him down in the rich land of Lycia.

　　Meanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and toAutomedon, pursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride andfoolishness of his heart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the sonof Peleus, he would have, escaped death and have been scatheless;but the counsels of Jove pass man's understanding; he will put evena brave man to flight and snatch victory from his grasp, or again hewill set him on to fight, as he now did when he put a high spirit intothe heart of Patroclus.

　　Who then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, whenthe gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus,Autonous, Echeclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor andMelanippus; after these he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes.These he slew, but the rest saved themselves by flight.

　　The sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands ofPatroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not PhoebusApollo taken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and toaid the Trojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the highwall, and thrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield withhis own immortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god foryet a fourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said,"Draw back, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city ofthe Trojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of Achilles who is afar better man than you are." On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew tosome distance and avoided the anger of Apollo.

　　Meanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaeangates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or tocall the army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollodrew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius,who was Hector's uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son ofDymas who lived in Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; inhis likeness Jove's son Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, "Hector,why have you left off fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were asmuch better a man than you, as I am worse, you should soon rue yourslackness. Drive straight towards Patroclus, if so be that Apollomay grant you a triumph over him, and you may rull him."

　　With this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector badeCebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them, andstruck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector and theTrojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no man, butdrove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his chariot tothe ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right a jaggedstone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and threw it,nor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not invain, for the stone struck Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, a bastardson of Priam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone hit himon the forehead and drove his brows into his head for the bone wassmashed, and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He droppeddead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there was nomore life left in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O knightPatroclus, saying, "Bless my heart, how active he is, and how wellhe dives. If we had been at sea this fellow would have dived fromthe ship's side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew couldstomach, even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off hischariot on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are divers alsoamong the Trojans."

　　As he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as itwere, of a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struckin the chest, and his courage is his own bane- even so furiously, OPatroclus, did you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also fromhis chariot to the ground. The pair then fought over the body ofCebriones. As two lions fight fiercely on some high mountain overthe body of a stag that they have killed, even so did these two mightywarriors, Patroclus son of Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew atone another over the corpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let himgo when he had once got him by the head, while Patroclus kept fasthold of his feet, and a fierce fight raged between the other Danaansand Trojans. As the east and south wind buffet one another when theybeat upon some dense forest on the mountains- there is beech and ashand spreading cornel; the to of the trees roar as they beat on oneanother, and one can hear the boughs cracking and breaking- even sodid the Trojans and Achaeans spring upon one another and lay abouteach other, and neither side would give way. Many a pointed spear fellto ground and many a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about thebody of Cebriones; many a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shieldas they fought around his body, but there he lay in the whirlingclouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now.

　　So long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons ofeither side were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he wentdown towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans provedto be beyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out ofrange of the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped thearmour from his shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierceintent and a terrific shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he killnine men; but as he was coming on like a god for a time, then, OPatroclus, was the hour of your end approaching, for Phoebus foughtyou in fell earnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about inthe crush, for he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struckhim from behind on his back and his broad shoulders with the flat ofhis hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat thehelmet from off his head, and it rolled rattling off under the horses'feet, where its horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust andblood. Never indeed had that helmet fared so before, for it had servedto protect the head and comely forehead of the godlike heroAchilles. Now, however, Zeus delivered it over to be worn by Hector.Nevertheless the end of Hector also was near. The bronze-shod spear,so great and so strong, was broken in the hand of Patroclus, while hisshield that covered him from head to foot fell to the ground as didalso the band that held it, and Apollo undid the fastenings of hiscorslet.

　　On this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and hestood as one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, thebest spearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetestrunner, came behind him and struck him in the back with a spear,midway between the shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had comeup with his chariot had dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he inall the arts of war- he it was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove aweapon into you, but he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus thenran back into the crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of thewound; he would not stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmedthough he now was, to attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by theblow the god had given him and by the spear-wound, drew back undercover of his men in fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him tobe wounded and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, andwhen close up with him struck him in the lower part of the bellywith a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so that hefell heavily to the ground to the great of the Achaeans. As when alion has fought some fierce wild-boar and worsted him- the two fightfuriously upon the mountains over some little fountain at which theywould both drink, and the lion has beaten the boar till he canhardly breathe- even so did Hector son of Priam take the life of thebrave son of Menoetius who had killed so many, striking him from closeat hand, and vaunting over him the while. "Patroclus," said he, "youdeemed that you should sack our city, rob our Trojan women of theirfreedom, and carry them off in your ships to your own country. Fool;Hector and his fleet horses were ever straining their utmost to defendthem. I am foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day ofbondage from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here.Poor wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; andyet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly saying, 'Come notback to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have rent thebloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body. Thus I ween didhe charge you, and your fool's heart answered him 'yea' within you."

　　Then, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knightPatroclus: "Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturnand Apollo have vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquishedme so easily, and they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders;had twenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would havefallen before my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpoweredme, and among mortal men Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in thekilling of me. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, you tooshall live but for a little season; death and the day of your doom areclose upon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achillesson of Aeacus."

　　When he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul lefthis body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad fateand bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Deadthough he was, Hector still spoke to him saying, "Patroclus, whyshould you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son oflovely Thetis, may be smitten by my spear and die before me?"

　　As he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting hisfoot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. Hethen went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleetdescendant of Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortalsteeds which the gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore himswiftly from the field.

　　BOOK XVII

　　BRAVE Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus hadfallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armourto bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even sodid yellow-haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his roundshield and his spear in front of him, resolute to kill any whoshould dare face him. But the son of Panthous had also noted the body,and came up to Menelaus saying, "Menelaus, son of Atreus, draw back,leave the body, and let the bloodstained spoils be. I was first of theTrojans and their brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, letme, therefore, have my full glory among the Trojans, or I will takeaim and kill you."

　　To this Menelaus answered in great anger "By father Jove, boastingis an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savagewild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures, thanare the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out the daysof his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming me themeanest soldier among the Danaans. His own feet never bore him back togladden his wife and parents. Even so shall I make an end of youtoo, if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and do notface me, or it shall be worse for you. Even a fool may be wise afterthe event."

　　Euphorbus would not listen, and said, "Now indeed, Menelaus, shallyou pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whosewife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought griefunspeakable on his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if Ibring your head and armour and place them in the hands of Panthous andnoble Phrontis. The time is come when this matter shall be foughtout and settled, for me or against me."

　　As he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear didnot go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus then tookaim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawingback, and Menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaninghis whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The pointwent clean through his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him ashe fell heavily to the ground. His hair which was like that of theGraces, and his locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold,were all bedrabbled with blood. As one who has grown a fine youngolive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water- theplant is full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from everyquarter it puts forth its white blossoms till the blasts of somefierce hurricane sweep down upon it and level it with the ground- evenso did Menelaus strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour afterhe had slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in thepride of his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as itis feeding- first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and thengorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue andcry against him, but they stand aloof and will not come close tohim, for they are pale with fear- even so no one had the courage toface valiant Menelaus. The son of Atreus would have then carried offthe armour of the son of Panthous with ease, had not Phoebus Apollobeen angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief of the Cicons incitedHector to attack him. "Hector," said he, "you are now going afterthe horses of the noble son of Aeacus, but you will not take them;they cannot be kept in hand and driven by mortal man, save only byAchilles, who is son to an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus sonof Atreus has bestridden the body of Patroclus and killed thenoblest of the Trojans, Euphorbus son of Panthous, so that he canfight no more."

　　The god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul ofHector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranksand saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowingfrom his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour. On this hemade his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleamingarmour, and crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heardhim, he said to himself in his dismay, "Alas! what shall I do? I maynot let the Trojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallenfighting on my behalf, lest some Danaan who sees me should cry shameupon me. Still if for my honour's sake I fight Hector and theTrojans single-handed, they will prove too many for me, for Hectoris bringing them up in force. Why, however, should I thus hesitate?When a man fights in despite of heaven with one whom a godbefriends, he will soon rue it. Let no Danaan think ill of me if Igive place to Hector, for the hand of heaven is with him. Yet, if Icould find Ajax, the two of us would fight Hector and heaven too, ifwe might only save the body of Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus.This, of many evils would be the least."

　　While he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him withHector at their head; he therefore drew back and left the body,turning about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs andmen from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he isdaunted and slinks sulkily off- even so did Menelaus son of Atreusturn and leave the body of Patroclus. When among the body of hismen, he looked around for mighty Ajax son of Telamon, and presentlysaw him on the extreme left of the fight, cheering on his men andexhorting them to keep on fighting, for Phoebus Apollo had spread agreat panic among them. He ran up to him and said, "Ajax, my goodfriend, come with me at once to dead Patroclus, if so be that we maytake the body to Achilles- as for his armour, Hector already has it."

　　These words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among thefront ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped Patroclus ofhis armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take thebody to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with hisshield like wall before him, on which Hector withdrew under shelter ofhis men, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to theTrojans to take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; Ajax,therefore, covered the body of Patroclus with his broad shield andbestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if hunters have comeupon him in a forest when he is with his little ones- in the pride andfierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till theycover his eyes- even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, andby his side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow inhis heart.

　　Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector andrebuked him sternly. "Hector," said he, "you make a brave show, but infight you are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim toso great a reputation. Think how you may now save your town andcitadel by the hands of your own people born in Ilius; for you willget no Lycians to fight for you, seeing what thanks they have hadfor their incessant hardships. Are you likely, sir, to do anythingto help a man of less note, after leaving Sarpedon, who was at onceyour guest and comrade in arms, to be the spoil and prey of theDanaans? So long as he lived he did good service both to your city andyourself; yet you had no stomach to save his body from the dogs. Ifthe Lycians will listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to itsfate. If the Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which layshold of men who are fighting for their country and harassing those whowould attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into Ilius. Couldwe get this dead man away and bring him into the city of Priam, theArgives would readily give up the armour of Sarpedon, and we shouldget his body to boot. For he whose squire has been now killed is theforemost man at the ships of the Achaeans- he and his close-fightingfollowers. Nevertheless you dared not make a stand against Ajax, norface him, eye to eye, with battle all round you, for he is a braverman than you are."

　　Hector scowled at him and answered, "Glaucus, you should knowbetter. I have held you so far as a man of more understanding than anyin all Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid ofAjax. I fear neither battle nor the din of chariots, but Jove's willis stronger than ours; Jove at one time makes even a strong man drawback and snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will sethim on to fight. Come hither then, my friend, stand by me and seeindeed whether I shall play the coward the whole day through as yousay, or whether I shall not stay some even of the boldest Danaans fromfighting round the body of Patroclus."

　　As he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, "Trojans,Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends,and fight might and main, while I put on the goodly armour ofAchilles, which I took when I killed Patroclus."

　　With this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his menwho were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet gotfar. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changedhis armour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius and to theTrojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus,which the gods had given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his son;but the son did not grow old in his father's armour.

　　When Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof andarming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged hishead and muttered to himself saying, "A! poor wretch, you arm in thearmour of a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you recknothing of the doom that is already close upon you. You have killedhis comrade so brave and strong, but it was not well that you shouldstrip the armour from his head and shoulders. I do indeed endow youwith great might now, but as against this you shall not return frombattle to lay the armour of the son of Peleus before Andromache."

　　The son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fittedthe armour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, andfilled his whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode inamong the allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemedto all of them like the great son of Peleus himself. He went aboutamong them and cheered them on- Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon,Thersilochus, Asteropaeus, Deisenor and Hippothous, Phorcys,Chromius and Ennomus the augur. All these did he exhort saying,"Hear me, allies from other cities who are here in your thousands,it was not in order to have a crowd about me that I called youhither each from his several city, but that with heart and soul youmight defend the wives and little ones of the Trojans from thefierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress my people with your food andthe presents that make you rich. Therefore turn, and charge at thefoe, to stand or fall as is the game of war; whoever shall bringPatroclus, dead though he be, into the hands of the Trojans, and shallmake Ajax give way before him, I will give him one half of thespoils while I keep the other. He will thus share like honour withmyself."

　　When he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaanswith their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran highthat he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body- foolsthat they were, for he was about to take the lives of many. ThenAjax said to Menelaus, "My good friend Menelaus, you and I shallhardly come out of this fight alive. I am less concerned for thebody of Patroclus, who will shortly become meat for the dogs andvultures of Troy, than for the safety of my own head and yours. Hectorhas wrapped us round in a storm of battle from every quarter, andour destruction seems now certain. Call then upon the princes of theDanaans if there is any who can hear us."

　　Menelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help atthe top of his voice. "My friends," he cried, "princes and counsellorsof the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at thepublic cost, and give orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafeshim power and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I cannotdistinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden, andthink it shame that Patroclus should become meat and morsel for Trojanhounds."

　　Fleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his waythrough the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus andMeriones his esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others thatcame into the fight after these, who of his own self could name them?

　　The Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As agreat wave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-bornriver, and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of thebreakers that beat and buffet them- even with such a roar did theTrojans come on; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firmabout the son of Menoetius, and fenced him with their bronzeshields. Jove, moreover, hid the brightness of their helmets in athick cloud, for he had borne no grudge against the son of Menoetiuswhile he was still alive and squire to the descendant of Aeacus;therefore he was loth to let him fall a prey to the dogs of his foesthe Trojans, and urged his comrades on to defend him.

　　At first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew fromthe dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing anyone, nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did notlose it long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son ofPeleus alike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and madetowards the front like a wild boar upon the mountains when he standsat bay in the forest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths thathave attacked him- even so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily inamong the phalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who hadbestridden Patroclus and were most bent on winning glory by dragginghim off to their city. At this moment Hippothous brave son of thePelasgian Lethus, in his zeal for Hector and the Trojans, was draggingthe body off by the foot through the press of the fight, havingbound a strap round the sinews near the ancle; but a mischief soonbefell him from which none of those could save him who would havegladly done so, for the son of Telamon sprang forward and smote him onhis bronze-cheeked helmet. The plumed headpiece broke about thepoint of the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the stronghand of Ajax, so that the bloody brain came oozing out through thecrest-socket. His strength then failed him and he let Patroclus'foot drop from his hand, as he fell full length dead upon the body;thus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, and never repaidhis parents the cost of bringing him up, for his life was cut shortearly by the spear of mighty Ajax. Hector then took aim at Ajax with aspear, but he saw it coming and just managed to avoid it; the spearpassed on and struck Schedius son of noble Iphitus, captain of thePhoceans, who dwelt in famed Panopeus and reigned over much people; itstruck him under the middle of the collar-bone the bronze point wentright through him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, andhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.Ajax in his turn struck noble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the middle ofthe belly as he was bestriding Hippothous, and broke the plate ofhis cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his entrails and he clutchedthe ground in his palm as he fell to earth. Hector and those whowere in the front rank then gave ground, while the Argives raised aloud cry of triumph, and drew off the bodies of Phorcys and Hippothouswhich they stripped presently of their armour.

　　The Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans anddriven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the Argives,so great was their courage and endurance, would have achieved atriumph even against the will of Jove, if Apollo had not rousedAeneas, in the likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant whohad grown old in the service of Aeneas' aged father, and was at alltimes devoted to him. In his likeness, then, Apollo said, "Aeneas, canyou not manage, even though heaven be against us, to save highIlius? I have known men, whose numbers, courage, and self-reliancehave saved their people in spite of Jove, whereas in this case hewould much rather give victory to us than to the Danaans, if you wouldonly fight instead of being so terribly afraid."

　　Aeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted toHector saying, "Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on usif we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius throughour own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me thatJove the supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make forthe Danaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away deadPatroclus to the ships."

　　As he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who thenrallied and again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus son ofArisbas, a valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved withpity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and spearedApisaon son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver underthe midriff, so that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and wasthe best man of them all after Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forwardto avenge him and attack the Danaans, but this might no longer be,inasmuch as those about Patroclus were well covered by theirshields, and held their spears in front of them, for Ajax had giventhem strict orders that no man was either to give ground, or tostand out before the others, but all were to hold well togetherabout the body and fight hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them,and the earth ran red with blood as the corpses fell thick on oneanother alike on the side of the Trojans and allies, and on that ofthe Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless fight thoughmany fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defendand stand by one another.

　　Thus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as thoughit had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden overall that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the deadson of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought attheir ease in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them,and there was not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain.These last moreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting, forthey were some distance apart and beyond the range of one another'sweapons, whereas those who were in the thick of the fray suffered bothfrom battle and darkness. All the best of them were being worn outby the great weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes,Thrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death ofPatroclus, and believed him to be still alive and leading the vanagainst the Trojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve againstthe death or rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had orderedwhen he sent them from the ships into battle.

　　Thus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and thesweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on theirhands and eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son ofPeleus. It was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fatto his men, and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in aring and tug till the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for themany that pull at it, and it is well stretched- even so did the twosides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass of but alittle space- the Trojans steadfastly set on drag ing it into Ilius,while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships; andfierce was the fight between them. Not Mars himself the lord of hosts,nor yet Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make light of such abattle.

　　Such fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordainround the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not know that hehad fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way offthe ships. He had no idea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead, anddeemed that he would return alive as soon as he had gone close up tothe gates. He knew that he was not to sack the city neither with norwithout himself, for his mother had often told him this when he hadsat alone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels ofgreat Jove. Now, however, she had not told him how great a disasterhad befallen him in the death of the one who was far dearest to him ofall his comrades.

　　The others still kept on charging one another round the body withtheir pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say, "Myfriends, we can never again show our faces at the ships- better, andgreatly better, that earth should open and swallow us here in thisplace, than that we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearingoff Patroclus to their city."

　　The Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying,"Friends, though we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrinkfrom fighting." With such words did they exhort each other. Theyfought and fought, and an iron clank rose through the void air tothe brazen vault of heaven. The horses of the descendant of Aeacusstood out of the fight and wept when they heard that their driverhad been laid low by the hand of murderous Hector. Automedon,valiant son of Diores, lashed them again and again; many a time did hespeak kindly to them, and many a time did he upbraid them, but theywould neither go back to the ships by the waters of the broadHellespont, nor yet into battle among the Achaeans; they stood withtheir chariot stock still, as a pillar set over the tomb of somedead man or woman, and bowed their heads to the ground. Hot tears fellfrom their eyes as they mourned the loss of their charioteer, andtheir noble manes drooped all wet from under the yokestraps oneither side the yoke.

　　The son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. Hewagged his head, and muttered to himself, saying, "Poor things, whydid we give you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you areyourselves ageless and immortal? Was it that you might share thesorrows that befall mankind? for of all creatures that live and moveupon the earth there is none so pitiable as he is- still, Hector sonof Priam shall drive neither you nor your chariot. I will not have it.It is enough that he should have the armour over which he vaunts sovainly. Furthermore I will give you strength of heart and limb to bearAutomedon safely to the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojanstriumph still further, and go on killing till they reach the ships;whereon night shall fall and darkness overshadow the land."

　　As he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so thatthey shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariotswiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behindthem fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vultureamid a flock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed hedashed amid the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of hispursuit he killed no man, for he could not wield his spear and keephis horses in hand when alone in the chariot; at last, however, acomrade, Alcimedon, son of Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of himand came up behind his chariot. "Automedon," said he, "what god hasput this folly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind, thatyou fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed? He who was yourcomrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed in thearmour of the descendant of Aeacus."

　　Automedon son of Diores answered, "Alcimedon, there is no one elsewho can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can, saveonly Patroclus- while he was alive- peer of gods in counsel. Take thenthe whip and reins, while I go down from the car and fight.

　　Alcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip andreins, while Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw him hesaid to Aeneas who was near him, "Aeneas, counsellor of themail-clad Trojans, I see the steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus comeinto battle with weak hands to drive them. I am sure, if you thinkwell, that we might take them; they will not dare face us if we bothattack them."

　　The valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pairwent right on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dryox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also withthem, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill themen and capture the horses- fools that they were, for they were not toreturn scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed tofather Jove and was forthwith filled with courage and strengthabounding. He turned to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said,"Alcimedon, keep your horses so close up that I may feel theirbreath upon my back; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son ofPriam till he has killed us and mounted behind the horses; he willthen either spread panic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himselfbe killed among the foremost."

　　On this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, "Ajaxescaptains of the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to themthat are best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of usliving; for Hector and Aeneas who are the two best men among theTrojans, are pressing us hard in the full tide of war. Neverthelessthe issue lies on the lap of heaven, I will therefore hurl my spearand leave the rest to Jove."

　　He poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the roundshield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed itnot, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part of hisbelly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow behindthe horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck sothat it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus give onebound and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his body tillit made an end of him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but hesaw it coming and stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew pasthim and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went onquivering till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then havefought hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced theirway through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, andparted them for all their fury- for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromiuswere afraid and drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to theheart. Automedon, peer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of hisarmour and vaunted over him saying, "I have done little to assuagemy sorrow for the son of Menoetius, for the man I have killed is notso good as he was."

　　As he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them uponhis chariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet allsteeped in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.

　　And now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, forMinerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command offar-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encouragethe Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token tomankind either of war or of the chill storms that stay men fromtheir labour and plague the flocks- even so, wrapped in such radiantraiment, did Minerva go in among the host and speak man by man toeach. First she took the form and voice of Phoenix and spoke toMenelaus son of Atreus, who was standing near her. "Menelaus," saidshe, "it will be shame and dishonour to you, if dogs tear the noblecomrade of Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, andurge your men to be so also."

　　Menelaus answered, "Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minervavouchsafe me strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall Istand by Patroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, butHector is as a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, forJove is now granting him a time of triumph."

　　Minerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of theother gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders,and made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yetcome again and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man's blood-even so bold as this did she make him as he stood over Patroclus andthrew his spear. Now there was among the Trojans a man named Podes,son of Eetion, who was both rich and valiant. Hector held him in thehighest honour for he was his comrade and boon companion; the spear ofMenelaus struck this man in the girdle just as he had turned inflight, and went right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward,and Menelaus son of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into theranks of his own people.

　　Apollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in thelikeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the mostfavoured of all Hector's guests. In his likeness Apollo said, "Hector,who of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you havequailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier?Yet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, andhas slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podesson of Eetion.

　　A dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he madehis way to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of Saturnseized his bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sentforth his lightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis hegave victory to the Trojans and routed the Achaeans.

　　The panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keepinghis face turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear onthe upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazedthe top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck himfrom close at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitus son ofnoble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him fromfighting further. He looked about him in dismay, knowing that neveragain should he wield spear in battle with the Trojans. While Hectorwas in pursuit of Leitus, Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate overhis chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and theTrojans cheered aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son of Deucalionas he was standing on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, butthe spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer of Meriones whohad come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left the ships on footand would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans if Coiranus hadnot driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought life and rescueto Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of murderous Hector. ForHector hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the spear droveout his teeth and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that he fell fromhis chariot and let the reins fall to the ground. Meriones gatheredthem up from the ground and took them into his own hands, then he saidto Idomeneus, "Lay on, till you get back to the ships, for you mustsee that the day is no longer ours."

　　On this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had takenhold upon him.

　　Ajax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour ofthe Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. "Alas," said he, "even afool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All theirweapons strike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or a cowardthat hurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each oneof them without effect. What, then, will be best both as regardsrescuing the body, and our return to the joy of our friends who willbe grieving as they look hitherwards; for they will make sure thatnothing can now check the terrible hands of Hector, and that he willfling himself upon our ships. I wish that some one would go and tellthe son of Peleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heardthe sad news that the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I can seenot a man among the Achaeans to send, for they and their chariotsare alike hidden in darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from overthe sons of the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if youwill that we perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight."

　　Father Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwithhe chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out andall the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, "Look,Menelaus, and if Antilochus son of Nestor be still living, send him atonce to tell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all hiscomrades has fallen."

　　Menelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from astockyard- the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keepwatch the whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat oftheir herd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain,for darts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunthim for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away- evenso did Menelaus sorely against his will leave Patroclus, in great fearlest the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fallinto the hands of the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxesstraitly saying, "Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, nowindeed remember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous whilealive, bear it in mind now that he is dead."

　　With this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as aneagle, whose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird-however high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escapehim by crouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon itand make an end of it- even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes rangeround the mighty host of your followers to see if you could find theson of Nestor still alive. Presently Menelaus saw him on the extremeleft of the battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fightboldly. Menelaus went up to him and said, "Antilochus, come here andlisten to sad news, which I would indeed were untrue. You must seewith your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans,and giving victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was thebravest of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Runinstantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescuethe body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector alreadyhas it."

　　Antilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he wasspeechless; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance,but he did as Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he hadgiven his armour to a comrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horsesround, close beside him.

　　Thus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad newsto Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded to succourhis harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians- andgreatly did they miss him- but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, andhimself went back to Patroclus. He came running up to the two Ajaxesand said, "I have sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, butrage against Hector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fightwithout armour. What then will be our best plan both as regardsrescuing the dead, and our own escape from death amid the battle-criesof the Trojans?"

　　Ajax answered, "Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, andMeriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray,while we two behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one inheart as in name, and long used to fighting side by side with oneanother."

　　On this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms andlifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised ahue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the bodyaway, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar atthe loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at himas though they would tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns onthem in a fury, scaring and scattering them in all directions- even sodid the Trojans for a while charge in a body, striking with swordand with spears pointed ai both the ends, but when the two Ajaxesfaced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no man daredpress on to fight further about the dead.

　　In this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear thebody to the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them likefierce flames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city,and the houses fall in the glare of its burning- even such was theroar and tramp of men and horses that pursued them as they borePatroclus from the field. Or as mules that put forth all theirstrength to draw some beam or great piece of ship's timber down arough mountain-track, and they pant and sweat as they, go even sodid Menelaus and pant and sweat as they bore the body of Patroclus.Behind them the two Ajaxes held stoutly out. As some woodedmountain-spur that stretches across a plain will turn water andcheck the flow even of a great river, nor is there any stream strongenough to break through it- even so did the two Ajaxes face theTrojans and stern the tide of their fighting though they keptpouring on towards them and foremost among them all was Aeneas sonof Anchises with valiant Hector. As a flock of daws or starlingsfall to screaming and chattering when they see a falcon, foe to i'llsmall birds, come soaring near them, even so did the Achaean youthraise a babel of cries as they fled before Aeneas and Hector,unmindful of their former prowess. In the rout of the Danaans muchgoodly armour fell round about the trench, and of fighting there wasno end.

　　BOOK XVIII

　　THUS then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile thefleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reachedAchilles, and found him sitting by his tall ships and boding thatwhich was indeed too surely true. "Alas," said he to himself in theheaviness of his heart, "why are the Achaeans again scouring the plainand flocking towards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not nowbringing that sorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, sayingthat while I was yet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fallbefore the Trojans, and see the light of the sun no longer. I fear thebrave son of Menoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet Ibade him return to the ships as soon as he had driven back thosethat were bringing fire against them, and not join battle withHector."

　　As he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him andtold his sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. "Alas," he cried,"son of noble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed thatthey were untrue. Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging abouthis naked body- for Hector holds his armour."

　　A dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filledboth hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,disfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over hisshirt so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely atfull length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whomAchilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,beating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.Antilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his handsas he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into hisown throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard himas she was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father,whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus thatdwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There wereGlauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, thoe and dark-eyed Halie,Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe and Agave,Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome andCallianeira, Doris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea,Nemertes, Apseudes and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeiraand Ianassa, Maera, Oreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, withother Nereids who dwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave wasfilled with their multitude and they all beat their breasts whileThetis led them in their lament.

　　"Listen," she cried, "sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you mayhear the burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I haveborne the most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, heroamong heroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plantin a goodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fightthe Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house ofPeleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is inheaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless Iwill go, that I may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallenhim though he is still holding aloof from battle."

　　She left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weepingafter, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reachedthe rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long lineon to the sands, at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons weredrawn up in close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother wentup to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head andspoke piteously, saying, "My son, why are you thus weeping? Whatsorrow has now befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jovehas granted you the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your handsand besought him that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up attheir ships, and rue it bitterly in that you were no longer withthem."

　　Achilles groaned and answered, "Mother, Olympian Jove has indeedvouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me,seeing that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen- he whom I valuedmore than all others, and loved as dearly as my own life? I havelost him; aye, and Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrousarmour, so glorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when theylaid you in the couch of a mortal man. Would that you were stilldwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken tohimself some mortal bride. For now you shall have grief infinite byreason of the death of that son whom you can never welcome home-nay, I will not live nor go about among mankind unless Hector fallby my spear, and thus pay me for having slain Patroclus son ofMenoetius."

　　Thetis wept and answered, "Then, my son, is your end near at hand-for your own death awaits you full soon after that of Hector."

　　Then said Achilles in his great grief, "I would die here and now, inthat I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home, andin his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is therefor me? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought nosaving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so manyhave been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootlessburden upon the earth, I, who in fight have no peer among theAchaeans, though in council there are better than I. Therefore, perishstrife both from among gods and men, and anger, wherein even arighteous man will harden his heart- which rises up in the soul of aman like smoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than drops ofhoney. Even so has Agamemnon angered me. And yet- so be it, for itis over; I will force my soul into subjection as I needs must; Iwill go; I will pursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved sodearly, and will then abide my doom when it may please Jove and theother gods to send it. Even Hercules, the best beloved of Jove- evenhe could not escape the hand of death, but fate and Juno's fierceanger laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doomawaits me. Till then I will win fame, and will bid Trojan andDardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both theirhands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall theyknow that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer.Hold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you shallnot move me."

　　Then silver-footed Thetis answered, "My son, what you have said istrue. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but yourarmour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph uponhis own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not belasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the pressof battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break of day Ishall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from King Vulcan."

　　On this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said tothe sea-nymphs her sisters, "Dive into the bosom of the sea and goto the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as forme, I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and askhim to provide my son with a suit of splendid armour."

　　When she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves,while silver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring thearmour for her son.

　　Thus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, andmeanwhile the Achaeans were flying with loud cries before murderousHector till they reached the ships and the Hellespont, and theycould not draw the body of Mars's servant Patroclus out of reach ofthe weapons that were showered upon him, for Hector son of Priamwith his host and horsemen had again caught up to him like the flameof a fiery furnace; thrice did brave Hector seize him by the feet,striving with might and main to draw him away and calling loudly onthe Trojans, and thrice did the two Ajaxes, clothed in valour aswith a garment, beat him from off the body; but all undaunted he wouldnow charge into the thick of the fight, and now again he would standstill and cry aloud, but he would give no ground. As uplandshepherds that cannot chase some famished lion from a carcase, even socould not the two Ajaxes scare Hector son of Priam from the body ofPatroclus.

　　And now he would even have dragged it off and have wonimperishable glory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her wayas messenger from Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. Shecame secretly without the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, forJuno sent her, and when she had got close to him she said, "Up, son ofPeleus, mightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom thisfearful fight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another,the Danaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans aretrying to hale it away, and take it to wind Ilius: Hector is themost furious of them all; he is for cutting the head from the body andfixing it on the stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here nolonger; shrink from the thought that Patroclus may become meat for thedogs of Troy. Shame on you, should his body suffer any kind ofoutrage."

　　And Achilles said, "Iris, which of the gods was it that sent youto me?"

　　Iris answered, "It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son ofSaturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of theimmortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus."

　　Then fleet Achilles answered her saying, "How can I go up into thebattle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I shouldsee her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour fromVulcan; I know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield ofAjax son of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the frontrank and wielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus."

　　Iris said, 'We know that your armour has been taken, but go as youare; go to the deep trench and show yourelf before the Trojans, thatthey may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons ofthe Achaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle mayhardly be."

　　Iris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jovearose, and Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strongshoulders; she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from whichshe kindled a glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up intoheaven from some city that is being beleaguered on an island far outat sea- all day long do men sally from the city and fight theirhardest, and at the going down of the sun the line of beacon-firesblazes forth, flaring high for those that dwell near them to behold,if so be that they may come with their ships and succour them- even sodid the light flare from the head of Achilles, as he stood by thetrench, going beyond the wall- but he aid not join the Achaeans for heheeded the charge which his mother laid upon him.

　　There did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voicefrom afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing asthe note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the gatesof a city, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus, and whenthe Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the horsesturned back with their chariots for they boded mischief, and theirdrivers were awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyedgoddess had kindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.

　　Thrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,and thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown intoconfusion; whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneaththe wheels of their chariots and perished by their own spears. TheAchaeans to their great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of theweapons, and laid him on a litter: his comrades stood mourning roundhim, and among them fleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw histrue comrade lying dead upon his bier. He had sent him out with horsesand chariots into battle, but his return he was not to welcome.

　　Then Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the watersof Oceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug andturmoil of war.

　　Now the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked theirhorses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. Theykept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallenupon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having heldaloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first tospeak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both beforeand after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon thesame night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressedthem thus:-

　　"Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now toyour city and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we arefar from our walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnonthe Achaeans were easier to deal with, and I would have gladlycamped by the ships in the hope of taking them; but now I go ingreat fear of the fleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that he willnever bide here on the plain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fightwith equal valour, but he will try to storm our city and carry off ourwomen. Do then as I say, and let us retreat. For this is what willhappen. The darkness of night will for a time stay the son ofPeleus, but if he find us here in the morning when he sallies forth infull armour, we shall have knowledge of him in good earnest. Gladindeed will he be who can escape and get back to Ilius, and many aTrojan will become meat for dogs and vultures may I never live to hearit. If we do as I say, little though we may like it, we shall havestrength in counsel during the night, and the great gates with thedoors that close them will protect the city. At dawn we can arm andtake our stand on the walls; he will then rue it if he sallies fromthe ships to fight us. He will go back when he has given his horsestheir fill of being driven all whithers under our walls, and will bein no mind to try and force his way into the city. Neither will heever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so."

　　Hector looked fiercely at him and answered, "Polydamas, your wordsare not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within thecity. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? Inthe old-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over for itswealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out of ourhouses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia,for the hand of Jove has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,that the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory hereand to hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in thisfool's wise among the people. You will have no man with you; itshall not be; do all of you as I now say;- take your suppers in yourcompanies throughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakefulevery man of you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, lethim gather them and give them out among the people. Better letthese, rather than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will armand fight about the ships; granted that Achilles has again comeforward to defend them, let it be as he will, but it shall go hardwith him. I shall not shun him, but will fight him, to fall orconquer. The god of war deals out like measure to all, and theslayer may yet be slain."

　　Thus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted inapplause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding.They gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words ofPolydamas no man would heed. They took their supper throughout thehost, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mournedPatroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid hismurderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again andagain as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed himof his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he isfurious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he canfind him, for he is mad with rage- even so with many a sigh didAchilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, "Alas! vain were thewords with which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I saidthat I would bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he hadsacked Ilius and taken his share of the spoils- but Jove does not giveall men their heart's desire. The same soil shall be reddened hereat Troy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomedhome by the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even inthis place shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, nowthat I am left behind you, I will not bury you, till I have broughthither the head and armour of mighty Hector who has slain you.Twelve noble sons of Trojans will I behead before your bier toavenge you; till I have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships,and fair women of Troy and Dardanus, whom we have taken with spear andstrength of arm when we sacked men's goodly cities, shall weep overyou both night and day."

　　Then Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the firethat they might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon theyset a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threwsticks on to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot as theflame played about the belly of the tripod. When the water in thecauldron was boiling they washed the body, anointed it with oil, andclosed its wounds with ointment that had been kept nine years. Thenthey laid it on a bier and covered it with a linen cloth from headto foot, and over this they laid a fair white robe. Thus all nightlong did the Myrmidons gather round Achilles to mourn Patroclus.

　　Then Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, "So, Queen Juno, you havegained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would thinkthat the Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood."

　　And Juno answered, "Dread son of Saturn, why should you say thisthing? May not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than wedo, do what he can for another person? And shall not I- foremost ofall goddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign inheaven- devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?"

　　Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house ofVulcan, imperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes inheaven, a house of bronze wrought by the lame god's own hands. Shefound him busy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he wasmaking twenty tripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, andhe set wheels of gold under them all that they might go of their ownselves to the assemblies of the gods, and come back again- marvelsindeed to see. They were finished all but the ears of cunningworkmanship which yet remained to be fixed to them: these he was nowfixing, and he was hammering at the rivets. While he was thus atwork silver-footed Thetis came to the house. Charis, of gracefulhead-dress, wife to the far-famed lame god, came towards her as soonas she saw her, and took her hand in her own, saying, "Why have youcome to our house, Thetis, honoured and ever welcome- for you do notvisit us often? Come inside and let me set refreshment before you."

　　The goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on arichly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool alsounder her feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, "Vulcan, come here,Thetis wants you"; and the far-famed lame god answered, "Then it isindeed an august and honoured goddess who has come here; she it wasthat took care of me when I was suffering from the heavy fall whichI had through my cruel mother's anger- for she would have got rid ofme because I was lame. It would have gone hardly with me had notEurynome, daughter of the ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, andThetis, taken me to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them,and many beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups,and chains, did I make for them in their cave, with the roaring watersof Oceanus foaming as they rushed ever past it; and no one knew,neither of gods nor men, save only Thetis and Eurynome who took careof me. If, then, Thetis has come to my house I must make her duerequital for having saved me; entertain her, therefore, with allhospitality, while I put by my bellows and all my tools."

　　On this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legsplying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, andgathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge andwashed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donnedhis shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door.There were golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were likereal young women, with sense and reason, voice also and strength,and all the learning of the immortals; these busied themselves asthe king bade them, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon agoodly seat, and took her hand in his own, saying, "Why have youcome to our house, Thetis honoured and ever welcome- for you do notvisit us often? Say what you want, and I will do it for you at once ifI can, and if it can be done at all."

　　Thetis wept and answered, "Vulcan, is there another goddess inOlympus whom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so muchaffliction as he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did hemake subject to a mortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorelyagainst my will did I submit to the embraces of one who was butmortal, and who now stays at home worn out with age. Neither is thisall. Heaven vouchsafed me a son, hero among heroes, and he shot upas a sapling. I tended him as a plant in a goodly garden and senthim with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans, but never shall Iwelcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long as he lives to lookupon the light of the sun, he is in heaviness, and though I go tohim I cannot help him; King Agamemnon has made him give up themaiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had awarded him, and he wasteswith sorrow for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed the Achaeans in attheir ships' sterns and would not let them come forth; the elders,therefore, of the Argives besought Achilles and offered him greattreasure, whereon he refused to bring deliverance to them himself, butput his own armour on Patroclus and sent him into the fight withmuch people after him. All day long they fought by the Scaean gatesand would have taken the city there and then, had not Apollovouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of Menoetiusafter he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am suppliant atyour knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son, whose end isnear at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves fittedwith ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own whenhis true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now liesstretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul."

　　And Vulcan answered, "Take heart, and be no more disquieted aboutthis matter; would that I could hide him from death's sight when hishour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amazethe eyes of all who behold it."

　　When he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turningthem towards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellowsblew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, somefierce to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong asVulcan willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper intothe fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on itsblock, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took thetongs in the other.

　　First he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all overand binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; andthe baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in fivethicknesses, and with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.

　　He wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at herfull and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face ofheaven- the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which menalso call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing.Orion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus.

　　He wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum ofmen. In the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they weregoing about the city with brides whom they were escorting bytorchlight from their chambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and theyouths danced to the music of flute and lyre, while the women stoodeach at her house door to see them.

　　Meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was aquarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a manwho had been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paiddamages in full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each wastrying to make his own case good, and the people took sides, eachman backing the side that he had taken; but the heralds kept themback, and the elders sate on their seats of stone in a solemncircle, holding the staves which the heralds had put into their hands.Then they rose and each in his turn gave judgement, and there were twotalents laid down, to be given to him whose judgement should be deemedthe fairest.

　　About the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleamingarmour, and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it andaccept the half of what it contained. But the men of the city wouldnot yet consent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wivesand little children kept guard upon the walls, and with them werethe men who were past fighting through age; but the others salliedforth with Mars and Pallas Minerva at their head- both of them wroughtin gold and clad in golden raiment, great and fair with their armouras befitting gods, while they that followed were smaller. When theyreached the place where they would lay their ambush, it was on ariverbed to which live stock of all kinds would come from far and nearto water; here, then, they lay concealed, clad in full armour. Someway off them there were two scouts who were on the look-out for thecoming of sheep or cattle, which presently came, followed by twoshepherds who were playing on their pipes, and had not so much as athought of danger. When those who were in ambush saw this, they cutoff the flocks and herds and killed the shepherds. Meanwhile thebesiegers, when they heard much noise among the cattle as they satin council, sprang to their horses, and made with all speed towardsthem; when they reached them they set battle in array by the banksof the river, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at oneanother. With them were Strife and Riot, and fell Fate who wasdragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound, and the otherunwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragging him along byhis heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men's blood. They went in andout with one another and fought as though they were living peoplehaling away one another's dead.

　　He wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughedalready. Many men were working at the plough within it, turningtheir oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turnedon reaching the headland a man would come up to them and give them acup of wine, and they would go back to their furrows looking forwardto the time when they should again reach the headland. The part thatthey had ploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though itwas of gold, still looked as if it were being ploughed- very curiousto behold.

　　He wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers werereaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell tothe ground in a straight line behind them, and the binders boundthem in bands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behindthem there were boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kepton bringing them to be bound: among them all the owner of the landstood by in silence and was glad. The servants were getting a mealready under an oak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and werebusy cutting him up, while the women were making a porridge of muchwhite barley for the labourers' dinner.

　　He wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vineswere loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but thevines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metalall round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only onepath to it, and by this the vintagers went when they would gatherthe vintage. Youths and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carriedthe luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with them there went aboy who made sweet music with his lyre, and sang the Linus-song withhis clear boyish voice.

　　He wrought also a herd of homed cattle. He made the cows of gold andtin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go andfeed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Alongwith the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, andtheir nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions hadfastened on a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, andbellow as he might they haled him, while the dogs and men gavechase: the lions tore through the bull's thick hide and were gorgingon his blood and bowels, but the herdsmen were afraid to doanything, and only hounded on their dogs; the dogs dared not fasten onthe lions but stood by barking and keeping out of harm's way.

　　The god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and largeflock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.

　　Furthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once madein Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths andmaidens whom all would woo, with their hands on one another'swrists. The maidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths wellwoven shirts that were slightly oiled. The girls were crowned withgarlands, while the young men had daggers of gold that hung bysilver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly in a ring withmerry twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting at his work andmaking trial of his wheel to see whether it will run, and sometimesthey would go all in line with one another, and much people wasgathered joyously about the green. There was a bard also to sing tothem and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing inthe midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.

　　All round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty streamof the river Oceanus.

　　Then when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made abreastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made helmet,close fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plumeoverhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin.

　　Lastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he tookit and set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like afalcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleamingarmour from the house of Vulcan.

　　BOOK XIX

　　NOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams ofOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached theships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her sonfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many alsoof his followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess cameamong them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, "My son, grieve aswe may we must let this man lie, for it is by heaven's will that hehas fallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodlyarmour, which no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders."

　　As she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang outbravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and nonedared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was rousedto still greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, forhe was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god hadmade him. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking atit, he said to his mother, "Mother, the god has given me armour,meet handiwork for an immortal and such as no living could havefashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle uponthe son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that hisbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot."

　　Silver-footed Thetis answered, "My son, be not disquieted about thismatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisomeflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle.He may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as soundas ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes inassembly; unsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fightwith might and main."

　　As she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and shethen dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus,that his body might suffer no change.

　　Then Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry calledon the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed alwaysat the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards whowere about the ships and served out rations, all came to the placeof assembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloofso long from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son ofTydeus, came limping, for their wounds still pained them; neverthelessthey came, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Lastof all came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son ofAntenor had struck him with a spear in battle.

　　When the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, "Sonof Atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,when we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it wouldhave been better, had Diana's arrow slain her at the ships on theday when I took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many anAchaean the less would have bitten dust before the foe in the daysof my anger. It has been well for Hector and the Trojans, but theAchaeans will long indeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let itbe, for it is over. If we have been angry, necessity has schooledour anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever;therefore, bid the Achaeans arm forthwith that I may go out againstthe Trojans, and learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep bythe ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be to rest his knees who mayfly my spear when I wield it."

　　Thus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put awayhis anger.

　　Then Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into themiddle of the assembly. "Danaan heroes," said he, "servants of Mars,it is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is notseemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practisedspeaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest

　　orator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son ofPeleus, and do you other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often havethe Achaeans spoken to me of this matter and upbraided me, but itwas not I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks indarkness struck me mad when we were assembled on the day that I tookfrom Achilles the meed that had been awarded to him. What could Ido? All things are in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest ofJove's daughters, shuts men's eyes to their destruction. She walksdelicately, not on the solid earth, but hovers over the heads of mento make them stumble or to ensnare them.

　　"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatestwhether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled himon the day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the faircity of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, 'Hear me allgods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this dayshall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a manchild into the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about himwho are of my blood and lineage.' Then said Juno all crafty and fullof guile, 'You will play false, and will not hold to your word.Swear me, O Olympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall thisday fall between the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all thatdwell about him who are of your blood and lineage.'

　　"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the greatoath, to his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the highsummit of Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knewthat the noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She beingwith child and in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birththough there was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspringof Alcmena, and kept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jovethe son of Saturn, and said, 'Father Jove, lord of the lightning- Ihave a word for your ear. There is a fine child born this day,Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus the son of Perseus; he is of yourlineage; it is well, therefore, that he should reign over theArgives.'

　　"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caughtFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should sheagain invade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all.Then he whirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her downfrom heaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and hewas ever angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruellabours that Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve whenmighty Hector was killing the Argives at their ships, and all the timeI kept thinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Joverobbed me of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add muchtreasure by way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and yourpeople with you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered youyesterday in your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though youwould fain fight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from myship, that you may see whether what I give you is enough."

　　And Achilles answered, "Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, youcan give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them:it is in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is notwell to tarry talking about trifles, for there is a deed which is asyet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost,and laying low the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one ofyou when he is fighting."

　　Then Ulysses said, "Achilles, godlike and brave, send not theAchaeans thus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for thebattle will be no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven hasfilled both sides with fury; bid them first take food both bread andwine by the ships, for in this there is strength and stay. No mancan do battle the livelong day to the going down of the sun if he iswithout food; however much he may want to fight his strength will failhim before he knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and hislimbs will grow weary under him. But a man can fight all day if heis full fed with meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strengthwill stay till he has routed all his foes; therefore, send thepeople away and bid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bringout the gifts in presence of the assembly, that all may see them andyou may be satisfied. Moreover let him swear an oath before theArgives that he has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, norbeen with her after the manner of men and women; and do you, too, showyourself of a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in histents with a feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had yourdues in full. As for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteouslyin future; it is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amendsif he was wrong in the first instance."

　　And King Agamemnon answered, "Son of Laertes, your words please mewell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you wouldhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the nameof heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fainfight at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come frommy tent and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I chargeyou: take some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from mytents the gifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring thewomen also; furthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from thosethat are with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and tothe sun."

　　Then said Achilles, "Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see tothese matters at some other season, when there is breathing time andwhen I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of thosewhom Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon theplain? Let the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting andwithout food, till we have avenged them; afterwards at the goingdown of the sun let them eat their fill. As for me, Patroclus is lyingdead in my tent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the door, andhis comrades are mourning round him. Therefore I can take thought ofnothing save only slaughter and blood and the rattle in the throatof the dying."

　　Ulysses answered, "Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all theAchaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than alittle, but in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and ofgreater knowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting isa thing of which men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is wars steward,weighs the upshot, it may well prove that the straw which oursickles have reaped is far heavier than the grain. It may not bethat the Achaeans should mourn the dead with their bellies; day by daymen fall thick and threefold continually; when should we haverespite from our sorrow? Let us mourn our dead for a day and bury themout of sight and mind, but let those of us who are left eat anddrink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely. In that hourlet no man hold back, waiting for a second summons; such summons shallbode ill for him who is found lagging behind at our ships; let usrather sally as one man and loose the fury of war upon the Trojans."

　　When he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, withMeges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes,and Melanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. Theword was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought outthe seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twentymetal cauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought the womenskilled in useful arts, seven in number, with Briseis, which madeeight. Ulysses weighed out the ten talents of gold and then led the

　　way back, while the young Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts,and laid them in the middle of the assembly.

　　Agamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of agod came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knifewhich he wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began bycutting off some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands inprayer as he did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all silentand orderly to hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault ofheaven and prayed saying, "I call Jove the first and mightiest ofall gods to witness, I call also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes whodwell below and take vengeance on him who shall swear falsely, thatI have laid no hand upon the girl Briseis, neither to take her to mybed nor otherwise, but that she has remained in my tents inviolate. IfI swear falsely may heaven visit me with all the penalties which itmetes out to those who perjure themselves."

　　He cut the boar's throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirledit round his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed thefishes. Then Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, "Father Jove,of a truth you blind men's eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus hadnot else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly takenBriseis from me against my will. Surely Jove must have counselledthe destruction of many an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that wemay begin fighting."

　　On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his ownship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to theship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while thestable-men drove the horses in among the others.

　　Briseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body ofPatroclus, flung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing herbreast, her neck, and her lovely face with both her hands. Beautifulas a goddess she wept and said, "Patroclus, dearest friend, when Iwent hence I left you living; I return, O prince, to find you dead;thus do fresh sorrows multiply upon me one after the other. I sawhim to whom my father and mother married me, cut down before our city,and my three own dear brothers perished with him on the self-same day;but you, Patroclus, even when Achilles slew my husband and sackedthe city of noble Mynes, told me that I was not to weep, for yousaid you would make Achilles marry me, and take me back with him toPhthia, we should have a wedding feast among the Myrmidons. You werealways kind to me and I shall never cease to grieve for you."

　　She wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-makingas though their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each wasweeping for her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered roundAchilles and prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would notdo so. "I pray you," said he, "if any comrade will hear me, bid meneither eat nor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stayfasting even to the going down of the sun."

　　On this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons ofAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, whostayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of hissorrow: but he would not be comforted till he should have flunghimself into the jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinkingever of Patroclus. Then he said-

　　"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinnerready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans werehasting to fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat anddrink in my tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than thisI could not know, not even though I were to hear of the death of myfather, who is now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, whoam here fighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sakeof Helen, nor yet though I should hear that my son is no more- hewho is being brought up in Scyros- if indeed Neoptolemus is stillliving. Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall here at Troyaway from Argos, while you were to return to Phthia, bring back my sonwith you in your own ship, and show him all my property, mybondsmen, and the greatness of my house- for Peleus must surely beeither dead, or what little life remains to him is oppressed alikewith the infirmities of age and ever present fear lest he shouldhear the sad tidings of my death."

　　He wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as eachthought on what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturnlooked down with pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, "Mychild, you have quite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean outof your recollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate forthe loss of his dear comrade, and though the others are gone totheir dinner he will neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectarand ambrosia into his breast, that he may know no hunger."

　　With these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.She darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing onhis broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were armingthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar andambrosia into Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause hislimbs to fail him, she went back to the house of her mighty father.Thick as the chill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne onthe keen blasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaminghelmets, the bossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and theashen spears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, thewhole land was radiant with their flashing armour, and the sound ofthe tramp of their treading rose from under their feet. In the midstof them all Achilles put on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyesgleamed like fire, for his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus,then, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of thegod, the armour that Vulcan had made him.

　　First he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, andnext he did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung thesilver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took upthe shield so great and strong that shone afar with a splendour asof the moon. As the light seen by sailors from out at sea, when menhave lit a fire in their homestead high up among the mountains, butthe sailors are carried out to sea by wind and storm far from thehaven where they would be- even so did the gleam of Achilles' wondrousshield strike up into the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet,and set it upon his head, from whence it shone like a star, and thegolden plumes which Vulcan had set thick about the ridge of thehelmet, waved all around it. Then Achilles made trial of himself inhis armour to see whether it fitted him, so that his limbs couldplay freely under it, and it seemed to buoy him up as though it hadbeen wings.

　　He also drew his father's spear out of the spear-stand, a spear sogreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save onlyAchilles had strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ashfrom the topmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once givento Peleus, fraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimusbusied themselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made thebands fast about them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing thereins back towards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang upbehind the horses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour,resplendent as the sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice hechided with his father's horses saying, "Xanthus and Balius, famedoffspring of Podarge- this time when we have done fighting be sure andbring your driver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and donot leave him dead on the plain as you did Patroclus."

　　Then fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke- for white-armed Juno hadendowed him with human speech- and he bowed his head till his manetouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. "DreadAchilles," said he, "we will indeed save you now, but the day ofyour death is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will beheaven and stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it throughany sloth or slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclusof his armour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slewhim as he fought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph toHector. We two can fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetestof all winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of aman and of a god."

　　When he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achillesanswered him in great sadness, saying, "Why, O Xanthus, do you thusforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am tofall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,shall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill offighting."

　　So saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.

　　BOOK XX

　　THUS, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O sonof Peleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans overagainst them armed upon the rise of the plain.

　　Meanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themisgather the gods in council, whereon she went about and called themto the house of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nora single one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs ofrivers and meadows of green grass. When they reached the house ofcloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats in the arcades ofpolished marble which Vulcan with his consummate skill had made forfather Jove.

　　In such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove.Neptune also, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of thegoddess, and came up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting inthe midst of them, he asked what Jove's purpose might be. "Why,"said he, "wielder of the lightning, have you called the gods incouncil? Are you considering some matter that concerns the Trojans andAchaeans- for the blaze of battle is on the point of being kindledbetween them?"

　　And Jove answered, "You know my purpose, shaker of earth, andwherefore I have called you hither. I take thought for them even intheir destruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt.Olympus and look on in peace, but do you others go about among Trojansand Achaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed.If Achilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make nostand against him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, andnow that he is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will overridefate itself and storm their city."

　　Thus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods tooktheir several sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva,earth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellentin all cunning- all these joined the host that came from the ships;with them also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with histhin legs plying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined theTrojans, and with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archergoddess Diana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus.

　　So long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors theAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fightwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him forfear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in hisarmour, and looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympianscame to take their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife,rouser of hosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing bythe deep trench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with allher might upon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed outupon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called onthe Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and nowspeeding up the side of the river Simois till he came to the hillCallicolone.

　　Thus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fiercecontention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men thunderedfrom heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth,and bade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests ofmany-fountained Ida quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and theships of the Achaeans. Hades, king of the realms below, was struckwith fear; he sprang panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud interror lest Neptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the groundover his head, and lay bare his mouldy mansions to the sight ofmortals and immortals- mansions so ghastly grim that even the godsshudder to think of them. Such was the uproar as the gods cametogether in battle. Apollo with his arrows took his stand to face KingNeptune, while Minerva took hers against the god of war; the

　　archer-goddess Diana with her golden arrows, sister of far-dartingApollo, stood to face Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer of good luckfaced Leto, while the mighty eddying river whom men can Scamander, butgods Xanthus, matched himself against Vulcan.

　　The gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But theheart of Achilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it waswith his blood that he longed above all things else to glut thestubborn lord of battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attackthe son of Peleus, and put courage into his heart, speaking with thevoice of Lycaon son of Priam. In his likeness therefore, he said toAeneas, "Aeneas, counsellor of the Trojans, where are now the bravewords with which you vaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes,saying that you would fight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?"

　　And Aeneas answered, "Why do you thus bid me fight the proud sonof Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, itwould not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to Rightfrom Ida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus andPedasus; Jove indeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength tofly, else had the fallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, whowent before him to protect him and urged him to fall upon theLelegae and Trojans. No man may fight Achilles, for one of the gods isalways with him as his guardian angel, and even were it not so, hisweapon flies ever straight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of himwho is against him; if heaven would let me fight him on even termshe should not soon overcome me, though he boasts that he is made ofbronze."

　　Then said King Apollo, son to Jove, "Nay, hero, pray to theever-living gods, for men say that you were born of Jove's daughterVenus, whereas Achilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus ischild to Jove, while Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea.Bring, therefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scareyou with his taunts and menaces."

　　As he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of hispeople, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremostfighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armedJuno, as he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She calledthe gods about her, and said, "Look to it, you two, Neptune andMinerva, and consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has beensending Aeneas clad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turnhim back at once, or shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow himwith strength so that his heart fail not, and he may learn that thechiefs of the immortals are on his side, while the others who have allalong been defending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all comedown from Olympus and join in the fight, that this day he may takeno hurt at the hands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whateverfate may have spun out for him when he was begotten and his motherbore him. If Achilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, hemay come to fear presently when one of us meets him in battle, for thegods are terrible if they are seen face to face."

　　Neptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, "Juno,restrain your fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcingthe other gods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on ourown side; let us take our places on some hill out of the beaten track,and let mortals fight it out among themselves. If Mars or PhoebusApollo begin fighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannotfight, we too, will at once raise the cry of battle, and in thatcase they will soon leave the field and go back vanquished toOlympus among the other gods."

　　With these words the dark-haired god led the way to the highearth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by theTrojans and Pallas Minerva for him fly to when the sea-monster waschasing him from the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and thosethat were with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud ofdarkness; but the other gods seated themselves on the brow ofCallicolone round you, O Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities.

　　Thus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither sidewas willing to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seaton high was in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain wasalive with men and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. Theearth rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushedtowards each other, and two champions, by far the foremost of themall, met between the hosts to fight- to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises,and noble Achilles.

　　Aeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmettossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before hisbreast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from theother side sprang forth to meet him, fike some fierce lion that thewhole country-side has met to hunt and kill- at first he bodes no ill,but when some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouchesopenmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tailfrom side to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springsstraight before him, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slainamong the foremost of his foes- even with such fury did Achillesburn to spring upon Aeneas.

　　When they were now close up with one another Achilles was first tospeak. "Aeneas," said he, "why do you stand thus out before the hostto fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seatof Priam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom overto you. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. Orhave the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness,fair with orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? Thisyou shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have youforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herdshelter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round tolook behind you; you took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked thecity, and with the help of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it andcarried its women into captivity, though Jove and the other godsrescued you. You think they will protect you now, but they will not doso; therefore I say go back into the host, and do not face me, oryou will rue it. Even a fool may be wise after the event."

　　Then Aeneas answered, "Son of Peleus, think not that your wordscan scare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can bragand talk unseemly. We know one another's race and parentage as mattersof common fame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor Iyours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus, and that yourmother is Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea. I have nobleAnchises for my father, and Venus for my mother; the parents of one orother of us shall this day mourn a son, for it will be more than sillytalk that shall part us when the fight is over. Learn, then, mylineage if you will- and it is known to many.

　　"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and foundedDardania, for Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men todwell in, and her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountainedIda. Dardanus had a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest ofall men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by thewater-meadows, they and their foals with them. Boreas was enamoured ofthem as they were feeding, and covered them in the semblance of adark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did they conceive and bearhim, and these, as they sped over the rich plain, would go bounding onover the ripe ears of corn and not break them; or again when theywould disport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they couldgallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius begat Tros, king of theTrojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus, Assaracus, andGanymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carriedhim off to be Jove's cupbearer, for his beauty's sake, that he mightdwell among the immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and Laomedon begatTithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the stock of Mars.But Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to Anchises, who was myfather, while Hector is son to Priam.

　　"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jovegives it or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now letthere be no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we werechildren. We could fling taunts without end at one another; ahundred-oared galley would not hold them. The tongue can run allwhithers and talk all wise; it can go here and there, and as a mansays, so shall he be gainsaid. What is the use of our bandying hardlike women who when they fall foul of one another go out and wranglein the streets, one half true and the other lies, as rage inspiresthem? No words of yours shall turn me now that I am fain to fight-therefore let us make trial of one another with our spears."

　　As he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield ofAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleusheld the shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid,for he deemed that Aeneas's spear would go through it quite easily,not reflecting that the god's glorious gifts were little likely toyield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas's spear didnot pierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god,stayed the point. It went through two layers, but the god had made theshield in five, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, andone of gold; it was in this that the spear was stayed.

　　Achilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas atthe very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelianash went clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas wasafraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him;the spear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in theground, after having gone through both circles of the shelteringshield. Aeneas though he had avoided the spear, stood still, blindedwith fear and grief because the weapon had gone so near him; thenAchilles sprang furiously upon him, with a cry as of death and withhis keen blade drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge thattwo men, as men now are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneaswielded it quite easily.

　　Aeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towardshim, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, andAchilles would have closed with him and despatched him with his sword,had not Neptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and saidforthwith to the immortals, "Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, whowill now go down to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son ofPeleus. Fool that he was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo.Apollo will never save him from destruction. Why should this mansuffer when he is guiltless, to no purpose, and in another'squarrel? Has he not at all times offered acceptable sacrifice to thegods that dwell in heaven? Let us then snatch him from death's jaws,lest the son of Saturn be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated,moreover, that he should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whomJove loved above all the sons born to him of mortal women, shall notperish utterly without seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated theblood of Priam, while Aeneas shall reign over the Trojans, he andhis children's children that shall be born hereafter."

　　Then answered Juno, "Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, andconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or sufferhim, brave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son ofPeleus. For of a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn fullmany a time before all the immortals, that never would we shieldTrojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is burning in theflames that the Achaeans shall kindle."

　　When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battleamid the clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles andAeneas were. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the sonof Peleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield ofAeneas, and laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneason high from off the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads ofmany a band of warriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god'shand sped him, till he came to the very fringe of the battle where theCauconians were arming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of theearth, then came near to him and said, Aeneas, what god has eggedyou on to this folly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both amightier man of valour and more beloved of heaven than you are? Giveway before him whensoever you meet him, lest you go down to thehouse of Hades even though fate would have it otherwise. When Achillesis dead you may then fight among the foremost undaunted, for noneother of the Achaeans shall slay you."

　　The god left him when he had given him these instructions, and atonce removed the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who openedthem wide indeed and said in great anger, "Alas! what marvel am Inow beholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not himwhom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also mustbe under heaven's protection, although I had thought his boastingwas idle. Let him go hang; he will be in no mood to fight mefurther, seeing how narrowly he has missed being killed. I will nowgive my orders to the Danaans and attack some other of the Trojans."

　　He sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he didso. "Let not the Trojans," he cried, "keep you at arm's length,Achaeans, but go for them and fight them man for man. Howevervaliant I may be, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all ofthem. Even Mars, who is an immortal, or Minerva, would shrink fromflinging himself into the jaws of such a fight and laying about him;nevertheless, so far as in me lies I will show no slackness of hand orfoot nor want of endurance, not even for a moment; I will utterlybreak their ranks, and woe to the Trojan who shall venture withinreach of my spear."

　　Thus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojansand declared that he would fight Achilles. "Be not afraid, proudTrojans," said he, "to face the son of Peleus; I could fight godsmyself if the battle were one of words only, but they would be morethan a match for me, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deedof Achilles will fall somewhat short of his word; he will do inpart, and the other part he will clip short. I will go up againsthim though his hands be as fire- though his hands be fire and hisstrength iron."

　　Thus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against theAchaeans, and raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves intothe midst of their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector andsaid, "Hector, on no account must you challenge Achilles to singlecombat; keep a lookout for him while you are under cover of the othersand away from the thick of the fight, otherwise he will either hit youwith a spear or cut you down at close quarters."

　　Thus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he wasafraid when he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles thensprang upon the Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as witha garment. First he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of muchpeople whom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities,in the land of Hyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achillesstruck him full on the head as he was coming on towards him, and splitit clean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achillesvaunted over him saying, "You he low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero;your death is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where yourfather's estate lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddyingwaters of Hermus."

　　Thus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. Thechariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him inthe front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, avaliant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the templethrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay thespear, but it went right on, crushing the bone so that the braininside was shed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended.Then he struck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down fromhis chariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed hislast, bellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him tooffer him in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of theearth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying.Achilles then went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom hisfather had always forbidden to fight because he was the youngest ofhis sons, the one he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in hisfolly and showing off the fleetness of his feet, was rushing aboutamong front ranks until he lost his life, for Achilles struck him inthe middle of the back as he was darting past him: he struck himjust at the golden fastenings of his belt and where the two piecesof the double breastplate overlapped. The point of the spear piercedhim through and came out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning onto his knees and a cloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sankholding his entrails in his hands.

　　When Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his handsand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and hecould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised hisspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. WhenAchilles saw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, "This is hethat has wounded my heart most deeply and has slain my belovedcomrade. Not for long shall we two quail before one another on thehighways of war."

　　He looked fiercely on Hector and said, "Draw near, that you may meetyour doom the sooner." Hector feared him not and answered, "Son ofPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were achild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you area mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issuelies in the the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, maynot slay you with my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now."

　　He hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, andthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from goingtowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet infront of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry,bent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, andhid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards himspear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. Whenhe rushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, heshouted aloud saying, "Hound, this time too you have escaped death-but of a truth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whomit seems you pray before you go into battle, has again saved you;but if I too have any friend among the gods I will surely make anend of you when I come across you at some other time. Now, however,I will pursue and overtake other Trojans."

　　On this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of hisneck, and he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie andstayed Demouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of greatstature, by hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote himwith his sword and killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus andDardanus, sons of Bias, and threw them from their chariot, the onewith a blow from a thrown spear, while the other he cut down inhand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son of Alastor- he came upto Achilles and clasped his knees in the hope that he would sparehim and not kill him but let him go, because they were both of thesame age. Fool, he might have known that he should not prevail withhim, for the man was in no mood for pity or forbearance but was ingrim earnest. Therefore when Tros laid hold of his knees and soughta hearing for his prayers, Achilles drove his sword into his liver,and the liver came rolling out, while his bosom was all covered withthe black blood that welled from the wound. Thus did death close hiseyes as he lay lifeless.

　　Achilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with aspear, and the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. Healso struck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, whichbecame warm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyesof Echeclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear woundedDeucalion in the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united,whereon he waited Achilles' onset with his arm hanging down anddeath staring him in the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blowfrom his sword and flung it helmet and all away from him, and themarrow came oozing out of his backbone as he lay. He then went inpursuit of Rhigmus, noble son of Peires, who had come from fertileThrace, and struck him through the middle with a spear which fixeditself in his belly, so that he fell headlong from his chariot. Healso speared Areithous squire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turninghis horses in flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while thehorses were struck with panic.

　　As a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought- and thedense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues offire in every direction- even so furiously did Achilles rage, wieldinghis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom hewould slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokesbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor- andit is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle- evenso did the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies of theslain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car werebespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses' hoofs, andfrom the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on towin still further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.

　　BOOK XXI

　　NOW when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,begotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: onehalf he chased over the plain towards the city by the same way thatthe Achaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding daywith Hector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and Junosent down a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other halfwere hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into itwith a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again,as they swam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirlingeddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire-the flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and theyhuddle into the water- even so was the eddying stream of Xanthusfilled with the uproar of men and horses, all struggling inconfusion before Achilles.

　　Forthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning itagainst a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god,armed with his sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed theTrojans down on every side. Their dying groans rose hideous as thesword smote them, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish flyscared before a huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of somefair haven- for he is sure to eat all he can catch- even so did theTrojans cower under the banks of the mighty river, and whenAchilles' arms grew weary with killing them, he drew twelve youthsalive out of the water, to sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son ofMenoetius. He drew them out like dazed fawns, bound their hands behindthem with the girdles of their own shirts, and gave them over to hismen to take back to the ships. Then he sprang into the river,thirsting for still further blood.

　　There he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he wasescaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisonerwhen he was in his father's vineyard, having set upon him by night, ashe was cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wickersides of a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares,and sent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him.But a guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum,and sent him to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to hisfather's house. He had spent eleven days happily with his friendsafter he had come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven againdelivered him into the hands of Achilles, who was to send him to thehouse of Hades sorely against his will. He was unarmed when Achillescaught sight of him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had heany spear, for he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank,and was sweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so thathis strength was now failing him.

　　Then Achilles said to himself in his surprise, "What marvel do I seehere? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over intoLemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising fromthe world below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprisonhim, as they do many another whether he will or no? This time lethim taste my spear, that I may know for certain whether mother earthwho can keep even a strong man down, will be able to hold him, orwhether thence too he will return."

　　Thus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed andtrying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.Achilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaonran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passedover his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was forblood. With one hand he caught Achilles' knees as he besought him, andwith the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go. Thenhe said, "Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am yoursuppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the daywhen you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold awayto Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you theprice of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times as much to gain myfreedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after muchsuffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.Surely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you asecond time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me,daughter of aged Altes- of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegaeand holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married hisdaughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,both of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus ashe was fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befallme, for I fear that I shall not escape you since heaven has deliveredme over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart,spare me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew yourbrave and noble comrade."

　　With such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles;but Achilles answered him sternly. "Idiot," said he, "talk not to meof ransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojansquarter, and sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive;but now not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into myhands before the city of Ilius- and of all Trojans it shall farehardest with the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shalldie. Why should you whine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was abetter man than you are. I too- see you not how I am great and goodly?I am son to a noble father, and have a goddess for my mother, butthe hands of doom and death overshadow me all as surely. The daywill come, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when oneshall take my life also in battle, either with his spear, or with anarrow sped from his bow."

　　Thus did he speak, and Lycaon's heart sank within him. He loosed hishold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achillesdrew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck; heplunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon helay at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from himtill the earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot andflung him into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him thewhile, and saying, "Lie there among the fishes, who will lick theblood from your wound and gloat over it; your mother shall not lay youon any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall bear youinto the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed on thefat of Lycaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the waters- soperish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilius- you inflight, and I following after to destroy you. The river with its broadsilver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls youoffered him and all the horses that you flung living into hiswaters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not aman of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and thehavoc you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while Iheld aloof from battle."

　　So spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, andpondered within himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles andsave the Trojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spearin hand, sprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He wasson to the broad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter ofAcessamenus; for the river had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up outof the water to face him with a spear in either hand, and Xanthusfilled him with courage, being angry for the death of the youthswhom Achilles was slaying ruthlessly within his waters. When they wereclose up with one another Achilles was first to speak. "Who and whenceare you," said he, "who dare to face me? Woe to the parents whoseson stands up against me." And the son of Pelegon answered, "Great sonof Peleus, why should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile landof far Paeonia, captain of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven daysthat I am at Ilius. I am of the blood of the river Axius- of Axiusthat is the fairest of all rivers that run. He begot the famed warriorPelegon, whose son men call me. Let us now fight, Achilles."

　　Thus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash.Asteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both handsalike; with the one spear he struck Achilles' shield, but did notpierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;with the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right armdrawing dark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixeditself in the ground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles,fain to kill him, hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hithim and struck the steep bank of the river, driving the spear half itslength into the earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword andsprang furiously upon him. Asteropaeus vainly tried to drawAchilles' spear out of the bank by main force; thrice did he tug atit, trying with all his might to draw it out, and thrice he had toleave off trying; the fourth time he tried to bend and break it, butere he could do so Achilles smote him with his sword and killed him.He struck him in the belly near the navel, so that all his bowels camegushing out on to the ground, and the darkness of death came overhim as he lay gasping. Then Achilles set his foot on his chest andspoiled him of his armour, vaunting over him and saying, "Lie there-begotten of a river though you be, it is hard for you to strive withthe offspring of Saturn's son. You declare yourself sprung from theblood of a broad river, but I am of the seed of mighty Jove. My fatheris Peleus, son of Aeacus ruler over the many Myrmidons, and Aeacus wasthe son of Jove. Therefore as Jove is mightier than any river thatflows into the sea, so are his children stronger than those of anyriver whatsoever. Moreover you have a great river hard by if he can beof any use to you, but there is no fighting against Jove the son ofSaturn, with whom not even King Achelous can compare, nor the mightystream of deep-flowing Oceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with allsprings and deep wells proceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings ofgreat Jove, and his thunder that comes crashing out of heaven."

　　With this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now thathe had killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand,with the dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busynibbling and gnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then hewent in chase of the Paeonians, who were flying along the bank ofthe river in panic when they saw their leader slain by the hands ofthe son of Peleus. Therein he slew Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus,Mnesus, Thrasius, Oeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slainyet others, had not the river in anger taken human form, and spoken tohim from out the deep waters saying, "Achilles, if you excel all instrength, so do you also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with youto protect you: if, then, the son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to youto destroy all the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream,and do your grim work on land. My fair waters are now filled withcorpses, nor can I find any channel by which I may pour myself intothe sea for I am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilesslyslaying. I am in despair, therefore, O captain of your host, troubleme no further."

　　Achilles answered, "So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but Iwill never cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pentthem up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that Imay learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him."

　　As he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of thegods. But the river said to Apollo, "Surely, son of Jove, lord ofthe silver bow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who chargedyou straitly that you should stand by the Trojans and defend them,till twilight fades, and darkness is over an the earth."

　　Meanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon theriver raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his streaminto a torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slainand left within his waters. These he cast out on to the land,bellowing like a bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hidingthem in his mighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gatheredabout Achilles, falling upon him and beating on his shield, so that hecould not keep his feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but itcame up by the roots, and tore away the bank, damming the streamwith its thick branches and bridging it all across; whereby Achillesstruggled out of the stream, and fled full speed over the plain, forhe was afraid.

　　But the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon himwith a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojansfrom destruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear's throw fromhim; swift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongestand fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and thearmour rang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but theriver with a loud roar came tearing after. As one who would waterhis garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, andall his ground-spade in hand he clears away the dams to free thechannels, and the little stones run rolling round and round with thewater as it goes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow-even so did the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was afleet runner, for the gods are stronger than men. As often as he wouldstrive to stand his ground, and see whether or no all the gods inheaven were in league against him, so often would the mighty wave comebeating down upon his shoulders, and be would have to keep flying onand on in great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as itflowed past him and ate the ground from under his feet.

　　Then the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, "FatherJove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and saveme from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards. Iblame none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do mydear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was tofall under the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; wouldthat Hector, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me; thenshould I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seemsthat I shall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river asthough I were some swineherd's boy, who gets carried down a torrentwhile trying to cross it during a storm."

　　As soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him inthe likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.Neptune spoke first. "Son of Peleus," said he, "be not so exceedingfearful; we are two gods, come with Jove's sanction to assist you,I, and Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river; hewill abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you,if you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fightingtill you have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius- asmany of them as may escape. Then kill Hector and go back to the ships,for we will vouchsafe you a triumph over him."

　　When they had so said they went back to the other immortals, butAchilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge thegods had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood ofwaters, and much goodly armour of the youths that had been slain wasrifting about, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against thestream, speeding right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him,for Minerva had endowed him with great strength. NeverthelessScamander did not slacken in his pursuit, but was still more furiouswith the son of Peleus. He lifted his waters into a high crest andcried aloud to Simois saying, "Dear brother, let the two of us uniteto save this man, or he will sack the mighty city of King Priam, andthe Trojans will not hold out against him. Help me at once; fillyour streams with water from their sources, rouse all your torrents toa fury; raise your wave on high, and let snags and stones comethundering down you that we may make an end of this savage creaturewho is now lording it as though he were a god. Nothing shall serve himlonger, not strength nor comeliness, nor his fine armour, whichforsooth shall soon be lying low in the deep waters covered overwith mud. I will wrap him in sand, and pour tons of shingle round him,so that the Achaeans shall not know how to gather his bones for thesilt in which I shall have hidden him, and when they celebrate hisfuneral they need build no barrow."

　　On this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles,seething as it was with foam and blood and the bo&ies of the dead. Thedark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmedthe son of Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be sweptaway in the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out toVulcan her son. "Crook-foot," she cried, "my child, be up and doing,for I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us atonce, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and thewhite south wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bearthe flames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consumethem, while you go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees andwrapping him round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither byfair words nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Thenyou may stay your flames."

　　On this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon theplain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whosebodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plainwas dried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on anorchard that has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, andthe heart of the owner is glad- even so the whole plan was dried andthe dead bodies were consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on tothe river. He burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotusalso, with the rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by thebanks of the river. The eels and fishes that go darting abouteverywhere in the water, these, too, were sorely harassed by theflames that cunning Vulcan had kindled, and the river himself wasscalded, so that he spoke saying, "Vulcan, there is no god can holdhis own against you. I cannot fight you when you flare out your flamesin this way; strive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive theTrojans out of city immediately. What have I to do with quarrellingand helping people?"

　　He was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As acauldron upon 'a large fire boils when it is melting the lard ofsome fatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when thedry faggots blaze under it- even so were the goodly waters ofXanthus heated with the fire till they were boiling. He could flowno longer but stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the blastsof fire which cunning Vulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno andbesought her saying, "Juno, why should your son vex my stream withsuch especial fury? I am not so much to blame as all the others arewho have been helping the Trojans. I will leave off, since you sodesire it, and let son leave off also. Furthermore I swear never againwill I do anything to save the Trojans from destruction, not even whenall Troy is burning in the flames which the Achaeans will kindle."

　　As soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, "SonVulcan, hold now your flames; we ought not to use such violenceagainst a god for the sake of mortals."

　　When she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the riverwent back once more into his own fair bed.

　　Xanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Junostayed them though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel brokeout among the other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fellon one another with a mighty uproar- earth groaned, and the spaciousfirmament rang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he wassitting on Olympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming toblows among themselves. They were not long about beginning, and Marspiercer of shields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang atonce upon Minerva and reviled her. "Why, vixen," said he, "have youagain set the gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of yourheart? Have you forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to woundme, and yourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurtof my fair body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to me."

　　As he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis- soterrible that not even can Jove's lightning pierce it. Here didmurderous Mars strike her with his great spear. She drew back and withher strong hand seized a stone that was lying on the plain- greatand rugged and black- which men of old had set for the boundary of afield. With this she struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down.Nine roods did he cover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled inthe dust, while his armour rang rattling round him. But Minervalaughed and vaunted over him saying, "Idiot, have you not learnedhow far stronger I am than you, but you must still match yourselfagainst me? Thus do your mother's curses now roost upon you, for sheis angry and would do you mischief because you have deserted theAchaeans and are helping the Trojans."

　　She then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove'sdaughter Venus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all thetime, for it was only with great difficulty that he had come tohimself again. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, "Look,daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is againtaking Mars through the crowd out of the battle; go after her atonce."

　　Thus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made ather, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fellfainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at fulllength. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, "May all who help theTrojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwartas Venus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Hadthis been so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking thestrong city of Ilius."

　　Juno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollosaying, "Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm's length? it isnot well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will bedisgraceful to us if we return to Jove's bronze-floored mansion onOlympus without having fought each other; therefore come on, you arethe younger of the two, and I ought not to attack you, for I amolder and have had more experience. Idiot, you have no sense, andforget how we two alone of all the gods fared hardly round about Iliuswhen we came from Jove's house and worked for Laomedon a whole year ata stated wage and he gave us his orders. I built the Trojans thewall about their city, so wide and fair that it might beimpregnable, while you, Phoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales ofmany valleyed Ida. When, however, the glad hours brought round thetime of payment, mighty Laomedon robbed us of all our hire and sent usoff with nothing but abuse. He threatened to bind us hand and foot andsell us over into some distant island. He tried, moreover, to cutoff the ears of both of us, so we went away in a rage, furious aboutthe payment he had promised us, and yet withheld; in spite of allthis, you are now showing favour to his people, and will not join usin compassing the utter ruin of the proud Trojans with their wives andchildren."

　　And King Apollo answered, "Lord of the earthquake, you would have norespect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserablemortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of thefield, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay thisfighting at once and let them settle it among themselves."

　　He turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on thebrother of his own father. But his sister the huntress Diana,patroness of wild beasts, was very angry with him and said, "So youwould fly, Far-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheapvaunt to boot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me againhear you bragging in my father's house, as you have often done inthe presence of the immortals, that you would stand up and fightwith Neptune."

　　Apollo made her no answer, but Jove's august queen was angry andupbraided her bitterly. "Bold vixen," she cried, "how dare you crossme thus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold your ownagainst me. Jove made you as a lion among women, and lets you killthem whenever you choose. You will And it better to chase wildbeasts and deer upon the mountains than to fight those who arestronger than you are. If you would try war, do so, and find out bypitting yourself against me, how far stronger I am than you are."

　　She caught both Diana's wrists with her left hand as she spoke,and with her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed asshe beat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhedunder her blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and shefled weeping from under Juno's hand as a dove that flies before afalcon to the cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortuneto escape. Even so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow andarrows behind her.

　　Then the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, "Leto, Ishall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove'swives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that youworsted me in fair fight."

　　Leto then gathered up Diana's bow and arrows that had fallen aboutamid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all hasteafter her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove's bronze-flooredmansion on Olympus, and sat herself down with many tears on theknees of her father, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering allabout her. The son of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughingpleasantly the while began to question her saying, "Which of theheavenly beings, my dear child, has been treating you in this cruelmanner, as though you had been misconducting yourself in the face ofeverybody?" and the fair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, "Itwas your wife Juno, father, who has been beating me; it is alwaysher doing when there is any quarrelling among the immortals."

　　Thus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered thestrong city of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should nothold out and the Danaans should take the city then and there, beforeits hour had come; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back,some angry and some triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seatsbeside Jove lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept ondealing out death alike on the Trojans and on their As when thesmoke from some burning city ascends to heaven when the anger of thegods has kindled it- there is then toil for all, and sorrow for nota few- even so did Achilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.

　　Old King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down onhuge Achilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and therewas none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower andwith many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the bravewarders of the gate. "Keep the gates," said he, "wide open till thepeople come flying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and isdriving them in rout before him. I see we are in great peril. Assoon as our people are inside and in safety, close the strong gatesfor I fear lest that terrible man should come bounding inside alongwith the others."

　　As he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, andwhen these were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans.Apollo then came full speed out of the city to meet them and protectthem. Right for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst andgrimy with dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding hisspear furiously behind them. For he was as one possessed, and wasthirsting after glory.

　　Then had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy ifApollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor. Heput courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him,leaning against a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. WhenAgenor saw Achilles he stood still and his heart was clouded withcare. "Alas," said he to himself in his dismay, "if I fly beforemighty Achilles, and go where all the others are being driven in rout,he will none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How wouldit be were I to let Achilles drive the others before him, and then flyfrom the wall to the plain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spursof Ida and can hide in the underwood that is thereon? I could thenwash the sweat from off me in the river and in the evening return toIlius. But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he wouldsee me as I am hurrying from the city over the plain, and wouldspeed after me till he had caught me- I should stand no chance againsthim, for he is mightiest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out andmeet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can bepierced by pointed bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and mensay that he is but mortal despite the triumph that Jove son ofSaturn vouchsafes him."

　　So saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was nowfain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covertto attack a hunter- she knows no fear and is not dismayed by thebaying of the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her andwound her either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear haspierced her she will not give in till she has either caught him in hergrip or been killed outright- even so did noble Agenor son ofAntenor refuse to fly till he had made trial of Achilles, and took aimat him with his spear, holding his round shield before him andcrying with a loud voice. "Of a truth," said he, "noble Achilles,you deem that you shall this day sack the city of the proud Trojans.Fool, there will be trouble enough yet before it, for there is manya brave man of us still inside who will stand in front of our dearparents with our wives and children, to defend Ilius. Heretherefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be, here shall you cue.

　　As he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and thespear struck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newlywrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of himwhom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayedit. Achilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would notvouchsafe him glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in athick mist, sending him out of the battle unmolested Then hecraftily drew the son of Peleus away from going after the host, for heput on the semblance of Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who rantowards him to give him chase and pursued him over the corn lands ofthe plain, turning him towards the deep waters of the river Scamander.Apollo ran but a little way before him and beguiled Achilles by makinghim think all the time that he was on the point of overtaking him.Meanwhile the rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd withinthe city till their numbers thronged it; no longer did they darewait for one another outside the city walls, to learn who hadescaped and who were fallen in fight, but all whose feet and kneescould still carry them poured pell-mell into the town.

　　BOOK XXII

　　THUS the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweatfrom off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against thegoodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upontheir shoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hectorstay where he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then PhoebusApollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, "Why, son of Peleus, do you,who are but man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not yetfound out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did notharass the Trojans whom you had routed, and now they are withintheir walls, while you have been decoyed hither away from them. Me youcannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me."

　　Achilles was greatly angered and said, "You have baulked me,Far-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away fromthe wall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he gotwithin Ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved theTrojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but Iwould indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so."

　　On this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as thewinning horse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he isflying over the plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs ofAchilles bear him onwards. King Priam was first to note him as hescoured the plain, all radiant as the star which men call Orion'sHound, and whose beams blaze forth in time of harvest more brilliantlythan those of any other that shines by night; brightest of them allthough he be, he yet bodes ill for mortals, for he brings fire andfever in his train- even so did Achilles' armour gleam on his breastas he sped onwards. Priam raised a cry and beat his head with hishands as he lifted them up and shouted out to his dear son,imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed before the gates, forhis heart was set upon doing battle with Achilles. The old man reachedout his arms towards him and bade him for pity's sake come withinthe walls. "Hector," he cried, "my son, stay not to face this manalone and unsupported, or you will meet death at the hands of theson of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster that he is;would indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do, for so, dogsand vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on earth, and aload of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a brave sonhas he reft from me, either by killing them or selling them away inthe islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons fromamong the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon andPolydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they bestill alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them withgold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old man Altes endowedhis daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the houseof Hades, sorrow will it be to us two who were their parents; albeitthe grief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perishat the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to bethe guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both loseyour own life and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Havepity also on your unhappy father while life yet remains to him- on me,whom the son of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on thethreshold of old age, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughtershaled away as captives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little childrendashed to earth amid the rage of battle, and my sons' wives draggedaway by the cruel hands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds willtear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the lifeout of my body with sword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fedat my own table to guard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood andthen lie all distraught at my doors. When a young man falls by thesword in battle, he may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly;let what will be seen, all is honourable in death, but when an old manis slain there is nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogsshould defile his grey hair and beard and all that men hide forshame."

　　The old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not theheart of Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she baredher bosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. "Hector,"she cried, weeping bitterly the while, "Hector, my son, spurn not thisbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfortfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wallto protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should thewretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall everweep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogswill devour you at the ships of the Achaeans."

　　Thus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they movednot the heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting hugeAchilles as he drew nearer towards him. As serpent in its den upon themountains, full fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach ofman- he is filled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goeswrithing round his den- even so Hector leaned his shield against atower that jutted out from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted.

　　"Alas," said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, "if I gowithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach uponme, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the cityon that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I wouldnot listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Nowthat my folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men andTrojan women in the face, lest a worse man should say, 'Hector hasruined us by his self-confidence.' Surely it would be better for me toreturn after having fought Achilles and slain him, or to diegloriously here before the city. What, again, if were to lay down myshield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight upto noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen, who wasthe fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that Alexandrusbrought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeansdivide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?I might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take asolemn oath that they would hide nothing, but would divide into twoshares all that is within the city- but why argue with myself inthis way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; hewould kill me then and there as easily as though I were a woman,when I had off my armour. There is no parleying with him from somerock or oak tree as young men and maidens prattle with one another.Better fight him at once, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafevictory."

　　Thus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it wereMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder hebrandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamedaround him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fellupon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where hewas but fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles dartedafter him at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of allbirds, swoops down upon some cowering dove- the dove flies beforehim but the falcon with a shrill scream follows close after,resolved to have her- even so did Achilles make straight for Hectorwith all his might, while Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast ashis limbs could take him.

　　On they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under thewall, past the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wildfig-tree, till they came to two fair springs which feed the riverScamander. One of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from itas smoke from a burning fire, but the other even in summer is ascold as hail or snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here, hard bythe springs, are the goodly washing-troughs of stone, where in thetime of peace before the coming of the Achaeans the wives and fairdaughters of the Trojans used to wash their clothes. Past these didthey fly, the one in front and the other giving ha. behind him: goodwas the man that fled, but better far was he that followed after,and swiftly indeed did they run, for the prize was no mere beast forsacrifice or bullock's hide, as it might be for a common foot-race,but they ran for the life of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speedround the turning-posts when they are running for some great prize-a tripod or woman- at the games in honour of some dead hero, so didthese two run full speed three times round the city of Priam. Allthe gods watched them, and the sire of gods and men was the first tospeak.

　　"Alas," said he, "my eyes behold a man who is dear to me beingpursued round the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity forHector, who has burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in myhonour, at one while on the of many-valleyed Ida, and again on thecitadel of Troy; and now I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of himround the city of Priam. What say you? Consider among yourselves anddecide whether we shall now save him or let him fall, valiant thoughhe be, before Achilles, son of Peleus."

　　Then Minerva said, "Father, wielder of the lightning, lord ofcloud and storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doomhas long been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but weothers shall not be of a mind with you."

　　And Jove answered, "My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did notspeak in full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do withoutlet or hindrance as you are minded."

　　Thus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down shedarted from the topmost summits of Olympus.

　　Achilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing afawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, andhunts through glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him bycrouching under cover of a bush, but he will scent her out andfollow her up until he gets her- even so there was no escape forHector from the fleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to getnear the Dardanian gates and under the walls, that his people mighthelp him by showering down weapons from above, Achilles would gainon him and head him back towards the plain, keeping himself alwayson the city side. As a man in a dream who fails to lay hands uponanother whom he is pursuing- the one cannot escape nor the otherovertake- even so neither could Achilles come up with Hector, norHector break away from Achilles; nevertheless he might even yet haveescaped death had not the time come when Apollo, who thus far hadsustained his strength and nerved his running, was now no longer tostay by him. Achilles made signs to the Achaean host, and shook hishead to show that no man was to aim a dart at Hector, lest anothermight win the glory of having hit him and he might himself come insecond. Then, at last, as they were nearing the fountains for thefourth time, the father of all balanced his golden scales and placed adoom in each of them, one for Achilles and the other for Hector. As heheld the scales by the middle, the doom of Hector fell down deepinto the house of Hades- and then Phoebus Apollo left him. ThereonMinerva went close up to the son of Peleus and said, "NobleAchilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to theships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his lustof battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his father,aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here and takebreath, while I go up to him and persuade him to make a stand andfight you."

　　Thus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,leaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left himand went after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. Shecame close up to him and said, "Dear brother, I see you are hardpressed by Achilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city ofPriam, let us await his onset and stand on our defence."

　　And Hector answered, "Deiphobus, you have always been dearest tome of all my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforthI shall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have venturedoutside the wall for my sake when all the others remain inside."

　　Then Minerva said, "Dear brother, my father and mother went downon their knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remaininside, so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in anagony of grief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make astand and fight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve,that we may learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off ourspoils to the ships, or whether he shall fall before you."

　　Thus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the twowere now close to one another great Hector was first to speak. "Iwill-no longer fly you, son of Peleus," said he, "as I have been doinghitherto. Three times have I fled round the mighty city of Priam,without daring to withstand you, but now, let me either slay or beslain, for I am in the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges toone another by our gods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardiansof all covenants; let it be agreed between us that if Jovevouchsafes me the longer stay and I take your life, I am not totreat your dead body in any unseemly fashion, but when I have strippedyou of your armour, I am to give up your body to the Achaeans. Anddo you likewise."

　　Achilles glared at him and answered, "Fool, prate not to me aboutcovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves andlambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out anthrough. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me,nor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shallfall and glut grim Mars with his life's blood. Put forth all yourstrength; you have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldierand man of war. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva willforthwith vanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full forthe grief you have caused me on account of my comrades whom you havekilled in battle."

　　He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw itcoming and avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flewover his head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched itup and gave it back to Achilles without Hector's seeing her; Hectorthereon said to the son of Peleus, "You have missed your aim,Achilles, peer of the gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you thehour of my doom, though you made sure that he had done so. You werea false-tongued liar when you deemed that I should forget my valourand quail before you. You shall not drive spear into the back of arunaway- drive it, should heaven so grant you power, drive it intome as I make straight towards you; and now for your own part avoidmy spear if you can- would that you might receive the whole of it intoyour body; if you were once dead the Trojans would find the war aneasier matter, for it is you who have harmed them most."

　　He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was truefor he hit the middle of Achilles' shield, but the spear reboundedfrom it, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw thatthe weapon had sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismayfor he had no second spear. With a loud cry he called Diphobus andasked him for one, but there was no man; then he saw the truth andsaid to himself, "Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. Ideemed that the hero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within thewall, and Minerva has inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedinglynear at hand and there is no way out of it- for so Jove and his sonApollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have beenever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not thendie ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do somegreat thing that shall be told among men hereafter."

　　As he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strongby his side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles likea soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb ortimid hare- even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring uponAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrousshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with fourlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of goldwi which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as theevening star that shines brighter than all others through thestillness of night, even such was the gleam of the spear whichAchilles poised in his right hand, fraught with the death of nobleHector. He eyed his fair flesh over and over to see where he couldbest wound it, but all was protected by the goodly armour of whichHector had spoiled Patroclus after he had slain him, save only thethroat where the collar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders,and this is a most deadly place: here then did Achilles strike himas he was coming on towards him, and the point of his spear went rightthrough the fleshy part of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipeso that he could still speak. Hector fell headlong, and Achillesvaunted over him saying, "Hector, you deemed that you should comeoff scatheless when you were spoiling Patroclus, and recked not ofmyself who was not with him. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade,mightier far than he, was still left behind him at the ships, andnow I have laid you low. The Achaeans shall give him all due funeralrites, while dogs and vultures shall work their will upon yourself."

　　Then Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, "I pray you byyour life and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me atthe ships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold andbronze which my father and mother will offer you, and send my bodyhome, that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of firewhen I am dead."

　　Achilles glared at him and answered, "Dog, talk not to me neither ofknees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able tocut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill have done me,as I am that nothing shall save you from the dogs- it shall not be,though they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me onthe spot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son ofDardanus should bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so yourmother shall never lay you out and make lament over the son shebore, but dogs and vultures shall eat you utterly up."

　　Hector with his dying breath then said, "I know you what you are,and was sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard asiron; look to it that I bring not heaven's anger upon you on the daywhen Paris and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay youat the Scaean gates."

　　When he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon hissoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamentingits sad fate that it should en' youth and strength no longer. ButAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, "Die; for my part I willaccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it."

　　As he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on oneside; then he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector'sshoulders while the other Achaeans came running up to view hiswondrous strength and beauty; and no one came near him withoutgiving him a fresh wound. Then would one turn to his neighbour andsay, "It is easier to handle Hector now than when he was flinging fireon to our ships" and as he spoke he would thrust his spear into himanew.

　　When Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood amongthe Argives and said, "My friends, princes and counsellors of theArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, whohas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whetherwe should not attack the city in force, and discover in what mindthe Trojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will deserttheir city now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out eventhough he is no longer living. But why argue with myself in thisway, while Patroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, andunmourned- he Whom I can never forget so long as I am alive and mystrength fails not? Though men forget their dead when once they arewithin the house of Hades, yet not even there will I forget thecomrade whom I have lost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raisethe song of victory and go back to the ships taking this man alongwith us; for we have achieved a mighty triumph and have slain nobleHector to whom the Trojans prayed throughout their city as though hewere a god."

　　On this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced thesinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passedthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the bodyfast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. Then whenhe had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted,he lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dustrose from Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew allabroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jovehad now delivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outragein his own land.

　　Thus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. Hismother tore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry asshe looked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, andthroughout the city the people fell to weeping and wailing. It wasas though the whole of frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire.Hardly could the people hold Priam back in his hot haste to rushwithout the gates of the city. He grovelled in the mire and besoughtthem, calling each one of them by his name. "Let be, my friends," hecried, "and for all your sorrow, suffer me to go single-handed tothe ships of the Achaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man,if maybe he will respect the feeling of his fellow-men, and havecompassion on my old age. His own father is even such another asmyself- Peleus, who bred him and reared him to- be the bane of usTrojans, and of myself more than of all others. Many a son of mine hashe slain in the flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as Imay, I do so for one- Hector- more than for them all, and thebitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades.Would that he had died in my arms, for so both his ill-starredmother who bore him, and myself, should have had the comfort ofweeping and mourning over him."

　　Thus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the cityjoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing amongthe Trojans. "Alas, my son," she cried, "what have I left to livefor now that you are no more? Night and day did I glory in. youthroughout the city, for you were a tower of strength to all inTroy, and both men and women alike hailed you as a god. So long as youlived you were their pride, but now death and destruction havefallen upon you."

　　Hector's wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come totell her that her husband had remained without the gates. She was ather loom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web,and embroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set alarge tripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hectorwhen he came out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was nowbeyond the reach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by thehands of Achilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, andtrembled in every limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again shespoke to her waiting-women. "Two of you," she said, "come with me thatI may learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of myhusband's honoured mother; my own heart beats as though it wouldcome into my mouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some greatmisfortune for Priam's children must be at hand. May I never live tohear it, but I greatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat ofbrave Hector and has chased him on to the plain where he wassinglehanded; I fear he may have put an end to the reckless daringwhich possessed my husband, who would never remain with the body ofhis men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all invalour."

　　Her heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like amaniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached thebattlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon thewall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city- the horsesdragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships ofthe Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness ofnight and she fell fainting backwards. She tore the tiring from herhead and flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaitedband, and the veil which golden Venus had given her on the day whenHector took her with him from the house of Eetion, after havinggiven countless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband's sistersand the wives of his brothers crowded round her and supported her, forshe was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presentlybreathed and came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among theTrojans saying, 'Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share acommon lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I atThebes under the wooded mountain of Placus in the house of Eetionwho brought me up when I was a child- ill-starred sire of anill-starred daughter- would that he had never begotten me. You are nowgoing into the house of Hades under the secret places of the earth,and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whomyou and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now thatyou are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you.Even though he escape the horrors of this woful war with the Achaeans,yet shall his life henceforth be one of labour and sorrow, forothers will seize his lands. The day that robs a child of hisparents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, his cheeksare wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among the friendsof his father, plucking one by the cloak and another by the shirt.Some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold the cupfor a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must notdrink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parentsare alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words.'Out with you,' he will say, 'you have no father here,' and thechild will go crying back to his widowed mother- he, Astyanax, whoerewhile would sit upon his father's knees, and have none but thedaintiest and choicest morsels set before him. When he had played tillhe was tired and went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the armsof his nurse, on a soft couch, knowing neither want nor care,whereas now that he has lost his father his lot will be full ofhardship- he, whom the Trojans name Astyanax, because you, O Hector,were the only defence of their gates and battlements. The wrigglingwrithing worms will now eat you at the ships, far from your parents,when the dogs have glutted themselves upon you. You will lie naked,although in your house you have fine and goodly raiment made byhands of women. This will I now burn; it is of no use to you, foryou can never again wear it, and thus you will have respect shownyou by the Trojans both men and women."

　　In such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the womenjoined in her lament.

　　BOOK XXIII

　　THUS did they make their moan throughout the city, while theAchaeans when they reached the Hellespont went back every man to hisown ship. But Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke tohis brave comrades saying, "Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my owntrusted friends, not yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horseand chariot draw near to the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honourto the dead. When we have had full comfort of lamentation we willunyoke our horses and take supper all of us here."

　　On this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them intheir lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing roundthe body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning.The sands of the seashore and the men's armour were wet with theirweeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost.Chief in all their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid hisbloodstained hand on the breast of his friend. "Fare well," hecried, "Patroclus, even in the house of Hades. I will now do allthat I erewhile promised you; I will drag Hector hither and let dogsdevour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay beforeyour pyre to avenge you."

　　As he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely,laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. Theothers then put off every man his armour, took the horses from theirchariots, and seated themselves in great multitude by the ship ofthe fleet descendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with anabundant funeral banquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep andbleating goat did they butcher and cut up; many a tusked boarmoreover, fat and well-fed, did they singe and set to roast in theflames of Vulcan; and rivulets of blood flowed all round the placewhere the body was lying.

　　Then the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus toAgamemnon, but hardly could they persuade him to come with them, sowroth was he for the death of his comrade. As soon as they reachedAgamemnon's tent they told the serving-men to set a large tripodover the fire in case they might persuade the son of Peleus 'to washthe clotted gore from this body, but he denied them sternly, and sworeit with a solemn oath, saying, "Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiestof all gods, it is not meet that water should touch my body, till Ihave laid Patroclus on the flames, have built him a barrow, and shavedmy head- for so long as I live no such second sorrow shall ever drawnigh me. Now, therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands,but at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your men bring wood, andprovide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm ofdarkness; the fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the sooner,and the people shall turn again to their own labours."

　　Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made hasteto prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share sothat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had had enough to eat anddrink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the sonof Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of thesounding sea, in an open place where the waves came surging in oneafter another. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and easedthe burden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasingHector round windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drewnear him, like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light ofhis beaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirithovered over his head and said-

　　"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living,but now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with allspeed that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadowsof men that can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will notyet suffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wanderall desolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now yourhand I pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire,never shall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermoreshall we sit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; thecruel fate which was my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws aroundme- nay, you too Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath thewall of the noble Trojans.

　　"One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not mybones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as wewere brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius broughtme to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killedthe son of Amphidamas- not of set purpose, but in childish quarrelover the dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreatedme kindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones liein but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you byyour mother."

　　And Achilles answered, "Why, true heart, are you come hither tolay these charges upon me? will of my own self do all as you havebidden me. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms aroundone another, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows."

　　He opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have claspedhim in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as avapour, gibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to hisfeet, smote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, "Of a trutheven in the house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that haveno life in them; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus hashovered over head making piteous moan, telling me what I am to dofor him, and looking wondrously like himself."

　　Thus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourningabout the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. ThenKing Agamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bringwood, and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. Theywent out with woodmen's axes and strong ropes in their hands, andbefore them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, bystraight ways and crooked, and when they reached the heights ofmany-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many atall branching oak that came thundering down as they felled it. Theysplit the trees and bound them behind the mules, which then wendedtheir way as they best could through the thick brushwood on to theplain. All who had been cutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squireto Idomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a lineupon the seashore at the place where Achilles would make a mightymonument for Patroclus and for himself.

　　When they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the wholeground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achillesordered his brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yokeeach man his horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour andmounted each his chariot- they and their charioteers with them. Thechariots went before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloudin their tens of thousands after. In the midst of them his comradesbore Patroclus and covered him with the locks of their hair which theycut off and threw upon his body. Last came Achilles with his headbowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking to the house ofHades.

　　When they came to the place of which Achilles had told them theylaid the body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethoughthim of another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut offthe yellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. Helooked all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, "Spercheius,in vain did my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home tomy loved native land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holyhecatomb; fifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at yoursprings, where is your grove and your altar fragrant withburnt-offerings. Thus did my father vow, but you have not fulfilledhis prayer; now, therefore, that I shall see my home no more, I givethis lock as a keepsake to the hero Patroclus."

　　As he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, andall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sunwould have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presentlysaid to Agamemnon, "Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the peoplewill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease frommourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about gettingtheir dinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what iswanted here, and let the other princes also stay by me."

　　When King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to theirships, but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built apyre a hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead allsorrowfully upon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheepand oxen before the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them andwrapped the body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayedcarcases all round it. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jarsof honey and unguents; four proud horses did he then cast upon thepyre, groaning the while he did so. The dead hero had hadhouse-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay and threw upon the pyre;he also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans to the sword and laidthem with the rest, for he was full of bitterness and fury. Then hecommitted all to the resistless and devouring might of the fire; hegroaned aloud and callid on his dead comrade by name. "Fare well,"he cried, "Patroclus, even in the house of Hades; I am now doing allthat I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans shall theflames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall devourthe flesh of Hector son of Priam."

　　Thus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector,for Jove's daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, andanointed him with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not betorn when Achilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreoversent a dark cloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to thewhole place where Hector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parchhis body.

　　Now the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achillestherefore bethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed tothe two winds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. Hemade them many drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought themto come and help him that the wood might make haste to kindle andthe dead bodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying andstarted off to fetch the winds. They were holding high feast in thehouse of boisterous Zephyrus when Iris came running up to the stonethreshold of the house and stood there, but as soon as they set eyeson her they all came towards her and each of them called her to him,but Iris would not sit down. "I cannot stay," she said, "I must goback to the streams of Oceanus and the land of the Ethiopians whoare offering hecatombs to the immortals, and I would have my share;but Achilles prays that Boreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him,and he vows them goodly offerings; he would have you blow upon thepyre of Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are lamenting."

　　With this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rentthe air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on untilthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but whenthey reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flamesroared under the blast that they blew. All night long did they blowhard and beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp hisdouble cup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and callingupon the spirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the grounduntil the earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burningthe bones of his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts ofhis parents, even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body ofhis comrade, pacing round the bier with piteous groaning andlamentation.

　　At length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the lightwhich saffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, theflames fell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyondthe Thracian sea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. Theson of Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcomewith toil, till he fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they whowere about the son of Atreus drew near in a body, and roused himwith the noise and tramp of their coming. He sat upright and said,"Son of Atreus, and all other princes of the Achaeans, first pourred wine everywhere upon the fire and quench it; let us then gatherthe bones of Patroclus son of Menoetius, singling them out withcare; they are easily found, for they lie in the middle of the pyre,while all else, both men and horses, has been thrown in a heap andburned at the outer edge. We will lay the bones in a golden urn, intwo layers of fat, against the time when I shall myself go down intothe house of Hades. As for the barrow, labour not to raise a great onenow, but such as is reasonable. Afterwards, let those Achaeans who maybe left at the ships when I am gone, build it both broad and high."

　　Thus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. Firstthey poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched thefire. With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of theirloved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers offat: they then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it insidethe tent. They marked off the circle where the barrow should be,made a foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up theearth. When they had thus raised a mound they were going away, butAchilles stayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He broughtprizes from the ships-cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, nobleoxen, women with fair girdles, and swart iron.

　　The first prize he offered was for the chariot races- a womanskilled in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that hadears for handles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for theman who came in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare,unbroken, and in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodlycauldron that had never yet been on the fire; it was still bright aswhen it left the maker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prizewas two talents of gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yetunsoiled by smoke. Then he stood up and spoke among the Argivessaying-

　　"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes thatlie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time Ishould carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; youknow how far my steeds excel all others- for they are immortal;Neptune gave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them tomyself; but I shall hold aloof, I and my steeds that have lost theirbrave and kind driver, who many a time has washed them in clearwater and anointed their manes with oil. See how they stand weepinghere, with their manes trailing on the ground in the extremity oftheir sorrow. But do you others set yourselves in order throughout thehost, whosoever has confidence in his horses and in the strength ofhis chariot."

　　Thus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirredthemselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son ofAdmetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mightyDiomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had takenfrom Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him,yellow-haired Menelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleethorses, Agamemnon's mare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The marehad been given to Agamemnon by echepolus son of Anchises, that hemight not have to follow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and takehis ease; for Jove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived inspacious Sicyon. This mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus putunder the yoke.

　　Fourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus,made ready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father cameup to him to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in butlittle need. "Antilochus," said Nestor, "you are young, but Jove andNeptune have loved you well, and have made you an excellenthorseman. I need not therefore say much by way of instruction. You areskilful at wheeling your horses round the post, but the horsesthemselves are very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar yourchances. The other drivers know less than you do, but their horses arefleeter; therefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon someartifice whereby you may insure that the prize shall not slipthrough your fingers. The woodman does more by skill than by bruteforce; by skill the pilot guides his storm-tossed barque over the sea,and so by skill one driver can beat another. If a man go wide inrounding this way and that, whereas a man who knows what he is doingmay have worse horses, but he will keep them well in hand when he seesthe doubling-post; he knows the precise moment at which to pull therein, and keeps his eye well on the man in front of him. I will giveyou this certain token which cannot escape your notice. There is astump of a dead tree-oak or pine as it may be- some six feet above theground, and not yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork ofthe road; it has two white stones set one on each side, and there is aclear course all round it. It may have been a monument to some onelong since dead, or it may have been used as a doubling-post in daysgone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the markround which the chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, butas you stand in your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge onyour right-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a looserein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave ofyour wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or youwill wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces, which wouldbe sport for others but confusion for yourself. Therefore, my dearson, mind well what you are about, for if you can be first to roundthe post there is no chance of any one giving you the goby later,not even though you had Adrestus's horse Arion behind you horsewhich is of divine race- or those of Laomedon, which are the noblestin this country."

　　When Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down inhis place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They thenall mounted their chariots and cast lots.- Achilles shook thehelmet, and the lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; nextcame that of King Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son ofAtreus and of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed sonof Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took their places inline; Achilles showed them the doubling-post round which they wereto turn, some way off upon the plain; here he stationed his father'sfollower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and report truly.

　　At the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struckthem with the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. Theyflew full speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose fromunder them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were allflying in the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch theground, and then again they bounded into the air; the drivers stooderect, and their hearts beat fast and furious in their lust ofvictory. Each kept calling on his horses, and the horses scoured theplain amid the clouds of dust that they raised.

　　It was when they were doing the last part of the course on their wayback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and itwas seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheresnow took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallionsof Diomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus's chariot, andhe could feel their warm breath on his back and on his broadshoulders, for their heads were close to him as they flew over thecourse. Diomed would have now passed him, or there would have been adead heat, but Phoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip.Tears of anger fell from his eyes as he saw the mares going onfaster than ever, while his own horses lost ground through hishaving no whip. Minerva saw the trick which Apollo had played theson of Tydeus, so she brought him his whip and put spirit into hishorses; moreover she went after the son of Admetus in a rage and brokehis yoke for him; the mares went one to one side the course, and theother to the other, and the pole was broken against the ground.Eumelus was thrown from his chariot close to the wheel; his elbows,mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead was bruisedabove his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could find noutterance. But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and shotfar ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength into them and covered Diomedhimself with glory.

　　Menelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus calledto his father's horses. "On with you both," he cried, "and do yourvery utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son ofTydeus, for Minerva has put running into them, and has coveredDiomed with glory; but you must overtake the horses of the son ofAtreus and not be left behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will tauntyou. Why, my good fellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shallsurely be- Nestor will keep neither of you, but will put both of youto the sword, if we win any the worse a prize through yourcarelessness, fly after them at your utmost speed; I will hit on aplan for passing them in a narrow part of the way, and it shall notfail me."

　　They feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space wentquicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road hadsunk. The ground was broken, for the winter's rain had gathered andhad worn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus wasmaking towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, butAntilochus turned his horses out of the way, and followed him a littleon one side. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out,"Antilochus, you are driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the roadis too narrow here, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then;if you foul my chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief."

　　But Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he hadnot heard him. They went side by side for about as far as a youngman can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying hisstrength, and then Menelaus's mares drew behind, for he left offdriving for fear the horses should foul one another and upset thechariots; thus, while pressing on in quest of victory, they might bothcome headlong to the ground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus andsaid, "There is no greater trickster living than you are; go, andbad luck go with you; the Achaeans say not well that you haveunderstanding, and come what may you shall not bear away the prizewithout sworn protest on my part."

　　Then he called on his horses and said to them, "Keep your pace,and slacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary soonerthan yours, for they are neither of them young."

　　The horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, sothat they were soon nearly up with the others.

　　Meanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horseswent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust.Idomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running,for he was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the mostcommanding part of the ground. The driver was a long way off, butIdomeneus could hear him shouting, and could see the foremost horsequite plainly- a chestnut with a round white star, like the moon, onits forehead. He stood up and said among the Argives, "My friends,princes and counsellors of the Argives, can you see the running aswell as I can? There seems to be another pair in front now, andanother driver; those that led off at the start must have beendisabled out on the plain. I saw them at first making their wayround the doubling-post, but now, though I search the plain of Troy, Icannot find them. Perhaps the reins fell from the driver's hand sothat he lost command of his horses at the doubling-post, and could notturn it. I suppose he must have been thrown out there, and brokenhis chariot, while his mares have left the course and gone offwildly in a panic. Come up and see for yourselves, I cannot make outfor certain, but the driver seems an Aetolian by descent, ruler overthe Argives, brave Diomed the son of Tydeus."

　　Ajax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, "Idomeneus,why should you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when themares are still so far out upon the plain? You are none of theyoungest, nor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are alwayslaying down the law. You have no right to do so, for there arebetter men here than you are. Eumelus's horses are in front now, asthey always have been, and he is on the chariot holding the reins."

　　The captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, "Ajax you are anexcellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in muchelse as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod orcauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses arefirst. You will then know to your cost."

　　Ajax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and therewould have been yet further brawling between them, had not Achillesrisen in his place and said, "Cease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus;it is not you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do thelike: sit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speedingtowards the winning-post and will be bere directly. You will then bothof you know whose horses are first, and whose come after."

　　As he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying hiswhip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as theyflew over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver,and the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleethorses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, andthe horses came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them inthe middle of the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chestsfell in streams on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from hisgoodly chariot, and leaned his whip against his horses' yoke; braveSthenelus now lost no time, but at once brought on the prize, and gavethe woman and the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away.Then he unyoked the horses.

　　Next after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who hadpassed Menelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; buteven so Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to thehorse that draws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of ahorse's tail touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never muchspace between wheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelauswas no further than this behind Antilochus, though at first he hadbeen a full disc's throw behind him. He had soon caught him upagain, for Agamemnon's mare Aethe kept pulling stronger andstronger, so that if the course had been longer he would have passedhim, and there would not even have been a dead heat. Idomeneus's bravesquire Meriones was about a spear's cast behind Menelaus. His horseswere slowest of all, and he was the worst driver. Last of them allcame the son of Admetus, dragging his chariot and driving his horseson in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry, and stood up amongthe Argives saying, "The best man is coming in last. Let us give him aprize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second, but the firstmust go to the son of Tydeus."

　　Thus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying,and were for doing as he had said, but Nestor's son Antilochus stoodup and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. "Achilles," said he,"I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob meof my prize, because you think Eumelus's chariot and horses werethrown out, and himself too, good man that he is. He should haveprayed duly to the immortals; he would not have come in fast if he haddone so. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold inyour tents, with bronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something fromthis store if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you, andgive him a better prize even than that which you have now offered; butI will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her, lethim come on."

　　Achilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus,who was one of his dearest comrades. So he said-

　　"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I willgive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round itwhich I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him."

　　He bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent,and he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who receivedit gladly.

　　But Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. Anattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keepsilence: the hero then addressed them. "Antilochus," said he, "what isthis from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me cut apoor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front ofthem, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, Oprinces and counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show nofavour, lest one of the Achaeans say, 'Menelaus has got the marethrough lying and corruption; his horses were far inferior toAntilochus's, but he has greater weight and influence.' Nay, I willdetermine the matter myself, and no man will blame me, for I shalldo what is just. Come here, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is,whip in hand before your chariot and horses; lay your hand on yoursteeds, and swear by earth-encircling Neptune that you did notpurposely and guilefully get in the way of my horses."

　　And Antilochus answered, "Forgive me; I am much younger, KingMenelaus, than you are; you stand higher than I do and are thebetter man of the two; you know how easily young men are betrayed intoindiscretion; their tempers are more hasty and they have lessjudgement; make due allowances therefore, and bear with me; I willof my own accord give up the mare that I have won, and if you claimany further chattel from my own possessions, I would rather yield itto you, at once, than fall from your good graces henceforth, and dowrong in the sight of heaven."

　　The son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over toMenelaus, whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon afield of ripening corn, and the lands are bristling with theharvest- even so, O Menelaus, was your heart made glad within you.He turned to Antilochus and said, "Now, Antilochus, angry though Ihave been, I can give way to you of my own free will; you have neverbeen headstrong nor ill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youthhas got the better of your judgement; be careful how you outwit yourbetters in future; no one else could have brought me round soeasily, but your good father, your brother, and yourself have all ofyou had infinite trouble on my behalf; I therefore yield to yourentreaty, and will give up the mare to you, mine though it indeedbe; the people will thus see that I am neither harsh nor vindictive."

　　With this he gave the mare over to Antilochus's comrade Noemon,and then took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth,carried off the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, thetwo-handled urn, being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going upto him among the assembled Argives and saying, "Take this, my good oldfriend, as an heirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus- foryou shall see him no more among the Argives. I give you this prizethough you cannot win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight,and cannot enter for the javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand ofage has been laid heavily upon you."

　　So saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly andanswered, "My son, all that you have said is true; there is nostrength now in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands fromeither shoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as whenthe Epeans were burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sonsoffered prizes in his honour. There was then none that could viewith me neither of the Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor theAetolians. In boxing I overcame Clytomedes son of Enops, and inwrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron who had come forward against me.Iphiclus was a good runner, but I beat him, and threw farther withmy spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus. In chariot-racing alone didthe two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding their horses in frontof me, for they were angry at the way victory had gone, and at thegreater part of the prizes remaining in the place in which they hadbeen offered. They were twins, and the one kept on holding thereins, and holding the reins, while the other plied the whip. Such wasI then, but now I must leave these matters to younger men; I mustbow before the weight of years, but in those days I was eminentamong heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests inhonour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heartrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwilltowards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For allwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance."

　　Thereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks ofNestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, andpresently offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. Hebrought out a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of thecrowd- a she-mule never yet broken, but six years old-  when it ishardest of all to break them: this was for the victor, and for thevanquished he offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said amongthe Argives, "Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite ourtwo champion boxers to lay about them lustily and compete for theseprizes. He to whom Apollo vouchsafes the greater endurance, and whomthe Achaeans acknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back withhim to his own tent, while he that is vanquished shall have the doublecup."

　　As he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and greatstature, a skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his handon the mule and said, "Let the man who is to have the cup come hither,for none but myself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of allhere present, and none can beat me. Is it not enough that I shouldfall short of you in actual fighting? Still, no man can be good ateverything. I tell you plainly, and it shall come true; if any manwill box with me I will bruise his body and break his bones; thereforelet his friends stay here in a body and be at hand to take him awaywhen I have done with him."

　　They all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son ofMecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebesafter the fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat allthe people of Cadmus. The son of Tydeus was Euryalus's second,cheering him on and hoping heartily that he would win. First he puta waistband round him and then he gave him some well-cut thongs ofox-hide; the two men being now girt went into the middle of thering, and immediately fell to; heavily indeed did they punish oneanother and lay about them with their brawny fists. One could hear thehorrid crashing of their jaws, and they sweated from every pore oftheir skin. Presently Epeus came on and gave Euryalus a blow on thejaw as he was looking round; Euryalus could not keep his legs; theygave way under him in a moment and he sprang up with a bound, as afish leaps into the air near some shore that is all bestrewn withsea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the waves, and then fallsback into deep water. But noble Epeus caught hold of him and raisedhim up; his comrades also came round him and led him from the ring,unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and spitting greatclots of gore. They set him down in a swoon and then went to fetch thedouble cup.

　　The son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contestand showed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art ofwrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for settingupon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelveoxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner ofarts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among theArgives, "Stand forward, you who will essay this contest."

　　Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and craftyUlysses, full of wiles rose also. The two girded themselves and wentinto the middle of the ring. They gripped each other in their stronghands like the rafters which some master-builder frames for the roofof a high house to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked asthey tugged at one another with their mighty arms- and sweat rainedfrom them in torrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides andshoulders, but they kept on striving with might and main for victoryand to win the tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him;Ulysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire ofwatching them, Ajax said to ulysses, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,you shall either lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it betweenus."

　　He lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did notforget his cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee,so that he could not keep his feet, but fell on his back withUlysses lying upon his chest, and all who saw it marvelled. ThenUlysses in turn lifted Ajax and stirred him a little from the groundbut could not lift him right off it, his knee sank under him, andthe two fell side by side on the ground and were all begrimed withdust. They now sprang towards one another and were for wrestling yet athird time, but Achilles rose and stayed them. "Put not each otherfurther," said he, "to such cruel suffering; the victory is withboth alike, take each of you an equal prize, and let the otherAchaeans now compete."

　　Thus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on theirshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.

　　The son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running- amixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold sixmeasures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty;it was the work of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been broughtinto port by Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a presentof it to Thoas. Eueneus son of jason had given it to Patroclus inransom of Priam's son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prizein honour of his comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. Forthe second prize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for thelast there was to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and saidamong the Argives, "Stand forward, you who will essay this contest."

　　Forthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, andNestor's son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of histime. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. Thecourse was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son ofOileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him asthe shuttle is to a woman's bosom when she throws the woof acrossthe warp and holds it close up to her; even so close behind him wasUlysses- treading in his footprints before the dust could settlethere, and Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as heran swiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw himstraining his utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but whenthey were now nearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly toMinerva. "Hear me," he cried, "and help my feet, O goddess." Thusdid he pray, and Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his handsand his feet feel light, and when the runners were at the point ofpouncing upon the prize, Ajax, through Minerva's spite slipped uponsome offal that was lying there from the cattle which Achilles hadslaughtered in honour of Patroclus, and his mouth and nostrils wereall filled with cow dung. Ulysses therefore carried off themixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax and came in first. But Ajax tookthe ox and stood with his hand on one of its horns, spitting thedung out of his mouth. Then he said to the Argives, "Alas, the goddesshas spoiled my running; she watches over Ulysses and stands by himas though she were his own mother." Thus did he speak and they allof them laughed heartily.

　　Antilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to thebystanders, "You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have showntheir respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, andas for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale inspite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against himsave only Achilles."

　　He said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, andAchilles answered, "Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to nopurpose; I shall give you an additional half talent of gold." Hethen gave the half talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly.

　　Then the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield thathad been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus. Hestood up and said among the Argives, "We bid two champions put ontheir armour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another inthe presence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound theflesh of the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to himwill I give this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which Itook from Asteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership,and I will give each of them a hearty meal in my own tent."

　　Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mightyDiomed son of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on hisown side of the ring, they both went into the middle eager toengage, and with fire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelledas they beheld them, and when the two were now close up with oneanother, thrice did they spring forward and thrice try to strikeeach other in close combat. Ajax pierced Diomed's round shield, butdid not draw blood, for the cuirass beneath the shield protectedhim; thereon the son of Tydeus from over his huge shield kept aimingcontinually at Ajax's neck with the point of his spear, and theAchaeans alarmed for his safety bade them leave off fighting anddivide the prize between them. Achilles then gave the great sword tothe son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and the leathern belt with whichto hang it.

　　Achilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion haderewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carriedit off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and saidamong the Argives, "Stand forward, you who would essay this contest.He who wins it will have a store of iron that will last him five yearsas they go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a townhis shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron,for he will have a stock of it on his own premises."

　　Then uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajaxson of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the otherand Epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which setall the Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race ofMars. Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond anymark that had been made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoithe hurled it as though it had been a stockman's stick which he sendsflying about among his cattle when he is driving them, so far didhis throw out-distance those of the others. All who saw it roaredapplause, and his comrades carried the prize for him and set it onboard his ship.

　　Achilles next offered a prize of iron for archery- tendouble-edged axes and ten with single eddies: he set up a ship's mast,some way off upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon toit by the foot; this was what they were to aim at. "Whoever," he said,"can hit the pigeon shall have all the axes and take them away withhim; he who hits the string without hitting the bird will have taken aworse aim and shall have the single-edged axes."

　　Then uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire ofIdomeneus rose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lotof Teucer fell first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but hedid not promise hecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, andmissed his bird, for Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string withwhich the bird was tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string cleanthrough so that it hung down towards the ground, while the bird flewup into the sky, and the Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, whohad his arrow ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the bow out ofhis hand, and at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb offirstling lambs to Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeonhigh up under the clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing asshe was circling upwards; the arrow went clean through the wing andfixed itself in the ground at Meriones' feet, but the bird perchedon the ship's mast hanging her head and with all her feathersdrooping; the life went out of her, and she fell heavily from themast. Meriones, therefore, took all ten double-edged axes, whileTeucer bore off the single-edged ones to his ships.

　　Then the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that hadnever been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with apattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up- towit the son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwartsquire of Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, "Son of Atreus, weknow how far you excel all others both in power and in throwing thejavelin; take the cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it soplease you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this at least is what Ishould myself wish."

　　King Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones,and handed the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.

　　BOOK XXIV

　　THE assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to hisown ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethoughtthem of the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept forthinking of his dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow,could take no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn as heyearned after the might and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of allthey had done together, and all they had gone through both on thefield of battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt onthese things he wept bitterly and lay now on his side, now on hisback, and now face downwards, till at last he rose and went out as onedistraught to wander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawnbreaking over beach and sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, andbound the body of Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thricedid he drag it round the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then wentback into his tent, leaving the body on the ground full length andwith its face downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to bedisfigured, for he pitied the man, dead though he now was; thereforehe shielded him with his golden aegis continually, that he mighttake no hurt while Achilles was dragging him.

　　Thus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but theblessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury,slayer of Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save onlyJuno, Neptune, and Jove's grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in thehate which they had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and hispeople; for they forgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus indisdaining the goddesses who came to him when he was in hissheepyards, and preferring her who had offered him a wanton to hisruin.

　　When, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come,Phoebus Apollo spoke among the immortals saying, "You gods ought to beashamed of yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did notHector burn you thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? Andnow dare you not rescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon,with his mother and child, his father Priam, and his people, who wouldforthwith commit him to the flames, and give him his due funeralrites? So, then, you would all be on the side of mad Achilles, whoknows neither right nor ruth? He is like some savage lion that inthe pride of his great strength and daring springs upon men's flocksand gorges on them. Even so has Achilles flung aside all pity, and allthat conscience which at once so greatly banes yet greatly boons himthat will heed it. man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost-a son, it may be, or a brother born from his own mother's womb; yetwhen he has mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for ittakes much sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he hasslain noble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb of hiscomrade. It were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so,for brave though he be we gods may take it ill that he should vent hisfury upon dead clay."

　　Juno spoke up in a rage. "This were well," she cried, "O lord of thesilver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles;but Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman's breast, whereasAchilles is the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared andbrought up. I married her to Peleus, who is above measure dear tothe immortals; you gods came all of you to her wedding; you feastedalong with them yourself and brought your lyre- false, and fond of lowcompany, that you have ever been."

　　Then said Jove, "Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not beequal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods,as also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was myaltar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour ofsacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the bodyof mighty Hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be withoutAchilles coming to know it, for his mother keeps night and daybeside him. Let some one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and Iwill impart my counsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept aransom from Priam, and give up the body."

　　On this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Downshe plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus;the waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into thebottom as the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carrydeath to fishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with theother sea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midstof them weeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his ownland, on the rich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said,"Rise Thetis; Jove, whose counsels fail not, bids you come to him."And Thetis answered, "Why does the mighty god so bid me? I am in greatgrief, and shrink from going in and out among the immortals. Still,I will go, and the word that he may speak shall not be spoken invain."

　　The goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe moresombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her. Thewaves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the shorethey flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing sonof Saturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near him.Minerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side offather Jove. Juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoketo her in words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her back thecup; and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.

　　"So, goddess," said he, "for all your sorrow, and the grief that Iwell know reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither toOlympus, and I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine dayspast the immortals have been quarrelling about Achilles waster ofcities and the body of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer ofArgus steal the body, but in furtherance of our peace and amityhenceforward, I will concede such honour to your son as I will nowtell you. Go, then, to the host and lay these commands upon him; saythat the gods are angry with him, and that I am myself more angry thanthem all, in that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not give himup. He may thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time I willsend Iris to great Priam to bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans,and ransom his son, taking with him such gifts for Achilles as maygive him satisfaction.

　　Silver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith downshe darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to herson's tents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trustycomrades round him were busy preparing their morning meal, for whichthey had killed a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside himand caressed him with her hand saying, "My son, how long will you keepon thus grieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart,and think neither of food nor of woman's embraces; and yet these toowere well, for you have no long time to live, and death with thestrong hand of fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heedwhat I say, for I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the godsare angry with you, and himself more angry than them all, in thatyou keep Hector at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore lethim go, and accept a ransom for his body."

　　And Achilles answered, "So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motionthus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away."

　　Thus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discoursewith one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to thestrong city of Ilius. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, from the mansions ofOlympus, and tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the shipsof the Achaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to takesuch gifts with him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and heis to go alone, with no other Trojan, save only some honouredservant who may drive his mules and waggon, and bring back the body ofhim whom noble Achilles has slain. Let him have no thought nor fear ofdeath in his heart, for we will send the slayer of Argus to escorthim, and bring him within the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not killhim nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sinnot, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy."

　　On this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver hermessage. She went to Priam's house, and found weeping andlamentation therein. His sons were seated round their father in theouter courtyard, and their raiment was wet with tears: the old man satin the midst of them with his mantle wrapped close about his body, andhis head and neck all covered with the filth which he had clutchedas he lay grovelling in the mire. His daughters and his sons' wiveswent wailing about the house, as they thought of the many and bravemen who lay dead, slain by the Argives. The messenger of Jove stood byPriam and spoke softly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so."Take heart," she said, "Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart andfear not. I bring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards you. Icome as a messenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takesthought for you and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go andransom noble Hector, and take with you such gifts as shall givesatisfaction to Achilles. You are to go alone, with no Trojan, saveonly some honoured servant who may drive your mules and waggon, andbring back to the city the body of him whom noble Achilles hasslain. You are to have no thought, nor fear of death, for Jove willsend the slayer of Argus to escort you. When he has brought you withinAchilles' tent, Achilles will not kill you nor let another do so,for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he will entreat asuppliant with all honourable courtesy."

　　Iris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told hissons to get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggonfast upon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrantstore-room, high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his manytreasures were kept, and he called Hecuba his wife. "Wife," said he,"a messenger has come to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to theships of the Achaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such giftsas shall give satisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter?for my own part I am greatly moved to pass through the of the Achaeansand go to their ships."

　　His wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, "Alas, what hasbecome of that judgement for which you have been ever famous bothamong strangers and your own people? How can you venture alone tothe ships of the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slainso many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if thecruel savage sees you and lays hold on you, he will know neitherrespect nor pity. Let us then weep Hector from afar here in our ownhouse, for when I gave him birth the threads of overruling fate werespun for him that dogs should eat his flesh far from his parents, inthe house of that terrible man on whose liver I would fain fastenand devour it. Thus would I avenge my son, who showed no cowardicewhen Achilles slew him, and thought neither of Right nor of avoidingbattle as he stood in defence of Trojan men and Trojan women."

　　Then Priam said, "I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as abird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it beensome mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divinesfrom sacrifice- I should have deemed him false and have given him noheed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to face,therefore I will go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be myfate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it;let Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my son in myarms and mourned him to my heart's comforting."

　　So saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelvegoodly vestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelverugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighedout ten talents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods,four cauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had givenhim when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious,but he grudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body ofhis son. Then he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebukedthem with words of anger. "Out," he cried, "shame and disgrace to methat you are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are come toplague me here? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturnhas sent this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? Nay, youshall prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans will haveeasier work in killing you. As for me, let me go down within the houseof Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of the city."

　　He drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the oldman sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus,Paris, noble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loudbattle-cry, Deiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the oldman call near him. "Come to me at once," he cried, "worthless sons whodo me shame; would that you had all been killed at the ships ratherthan Hector. Miserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons inall Troy- noble Nestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hectorwho was a god among men, so that one would have thought he was sonto an immortal- yet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain themand those of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and lightof foot, heroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from yourown people, why do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, andput all these things upon it that I may set out on my way?"

　　Thus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father.They brought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body ofthe waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg onwhich it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it andrings for the reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-bandeleven cubits long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it onat the far end of the pole, and put the ring over the upright pinmaking it fast with three turns of the band on either side the knob,and bending the thong of the yoke beneath it. This done, theybrought from the store-chamber the rich ransom that was to purchasethe body of Hector, and they set it all orderly on the waggon; thenthey yoked the strong harness-mules which the Mysians had on a timegiven as a goodly present to Priam; but for Priam himself they yokedhorses which the old king had bred, and kept for own use.

　　Thus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of theircars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with agolden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make adrink-offering before they set out. She stood in front of the horsesand said, "Take this, make a drink-offering to father Jove, andsince you are minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray thatyou may come safely back from the hands of your enemies. Pray to theson of Saturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks downover all Troy, pray him to send his swift messenger on your righthand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to him ofall birds, that you may see it with your own eyes and trust it asyou go forth to the ships of the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove willnot send you this messenger, however set upon it you may be, I wouldnot have you go to the ships of the Argives."

　　And Priam answered, "Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well tolift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me."

　　With this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water overhis hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. Hewashed his hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made thedrink-offering and prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard andturning his eyes to heaven. "Father Jove," he said, "that rulestfrom Ida, most glorious and most great, grant that I may be receivedkindly and compassionately in the tents of Achilles; and send yourswift messenger upon my right hand, the bird of omen which isstrongest and most dear to you of all birds, that I may see it with myown eyes and trust it as I go forth to the ships of the Danaans."

　　So did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer.Forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birdsthat fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. Hiswings were spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made andwell-bolted door of a rich man's chamber. He came to them flyingover the city upon their right hands, and when they saw him theywere glad and their hearts took comfort within them. The old manmade haste to mount his chariot, and drove out through the innergateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Before himwent the mules drawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven by wiseIdaeus; behind these were the horses, which the old man lashed withhis whip and drove swiftly through the city, while his friendsfollowed after, wailing and lamenting for him as though he were on hisroad to death. As soon as they had come down from the city and hadreached the plain, his sons and sons-in-law who had followed himwent back to Ilius.

　　But Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did notescape the ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old manand pitied him; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, "Mercury,for it is you who are the most disposed to escort men on their way,and to hear those whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam tothe ships of the Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see himnor take note of him until he reach the son of Peleus."

　　Thus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus,did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering goldensandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; hetook the wand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep, or wakes themjust as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came toTroy and to the Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man ofnoble birth in the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the downjust coming upon his face.

　　Now when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius,they stayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river,for the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus sawMercury standing near them he said to Priam, "Take heed, descendant ofDardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a manwho I think will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses,or at least embrace his knees and implore him to take compassionupon us?

　　When he heard this the old man's heart failed him, and he was ingreat fear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood onend over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to himand took him by the hand, saying, "Whither, father, are you thusdriving your mules and horses in the dead of night when other menare asleep? Are you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hardby you, so cruel and relentless? Should some one of them see youbearing so much treasure through the darkness of the flying night,what would not your state then be? You are no longer young, and he whois with you is too old to protect you from those who would attack you.For myself, I will do you no harm, and I will defend you from anyone else, for you remind me of my own father."

　　And Priam answered, "It is indeed as you say, my dear son;nevertheless some god has held his hand over me, in that he has sentsuch a wayfarer as yourself to meet me so Opportunely; you are socomely in mien and figure, and your judgement is so excellent that youmust come of blessed parents."

　　Then said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "Sir, all thatyou have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you takingthis rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may besafe, or are you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that yourson has fallen who was the bravest man among you and was never lackingin battle with the Achaeans?"

　　And Priam said, "Wo are you, my friend, and who are your parents,that you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?"

　　The slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, "Sir, youwould prove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a timehave I set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argivesto their ships and putting them to the sword. We stood still andmarvelled, for Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus sufferedus not to fight. I am his squire, and came with him in the sameship. I am a Myrmidon, and my father's name is Polyctor: he is arich man and about as old as you are; he has six sons besidesmyself, and I am the seventh. We cast lots, and it fell upon me tosail hither with Achilles. I am now come from the ships on to theplain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will set battle in array aboutthe city. They chafe at doing nothing, and are so eager that theirprinces cannot hold them back."

　　Then answered Priam, "If you are indeed the squire of Achilles sonof Peleus, tell me now the Whole truth. Is my son still at theships, or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to hishounds?"

　　"Sir," replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "neitherhounds nor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying atthe tents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve daysthat he has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the wormseaten him although they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles dragshim cruelly round the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does himno hurt. You should come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew,with the blood all washed away, and his wounds every one of themclosed though many pierced him with their spears. Such care have theblessed gods taken of your brave son, for he was dear to them beyondall measure."

　　The old man was comforted as he heard him and said, "My son, seewhat a good thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals;for as sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that holdOlympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accepttherefore at my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and withheaven's help guide me till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus."

　　Then answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "Sir, you aretempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me,for you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilleswhom I fear and hold it great guiltless to defraud, lest some evilpresently befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even toArgos itself, and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land,that no one should attack you through making light of him who was withyou."

　　The bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, andseizing the whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules andhorses. When they reached the trench and the wall that was beforethe ships, those who were on guard had just been getting theirsuppers, and the slayer of Argus threw them all into a deep sleep.Then he drew back the bolts to open the gates, and took Priam insidewith the treasure he had upon his waggon. Ere long they came to thelofty dwelling of the son of Peleus for which the Myrmidons had cutpine and which they had built for their king; when they had built itthey thatched it with coarse tussock-grass which they had mown outon the plain, and all round it they made a large courtyard, whichwas fenced with stakes set close together. The gate was barred witha single bolt of pine which it took three men to force into its place,and three to draw back so as to open the gate, but Achilles could drawit by himself. Mercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought inthe treasure that he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Thenhe sprang from the chariot on to the ground and said, "Sir, it is I,immortal Mercury, that am come with you, for my father sent me toescort you. I will now leave you, and will not enter into the presenceof Achilles, for it might anger him that a god should befriendmortal men thus openly. Go you within, and embrace the knees of theson of Peleus: beseech him by his father, his lovely mother, and hisson; thus you may move him."

　　With these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprangfrom his chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in chargeof the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the housewhere Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found himwith his men seated at a distance from him: only two, the heroAutomedon, and Alcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendanceabout his person, for he had but just done eating and drinking, andthe table was still there. King Priam entered without their seeinghim, and going right up to Achilles he clasped his knees and kissedthe dread murderous hands that had slain so many of his sons.

　　As when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should havekilled some one in his own country, and must fly to a great man'sprotection in a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even sodid Achilles marvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one toanother and marvelled also, but Priam besought Achilles saying, "Thinkof your father, O Achilles like unto the gods, who is such even as Iam, on the sad threshold of old age. It may be that those who dwellnear him harass him, and there is none to keep war and ruin fromhim. Yet when he hears of you being still alive, he is glad, and hisdays are full of hope that he shall see his dear son come home tohim from Troy; but I, wretched man that I am, had the bravest in allTroy for my sons, and there is not one of them left. I had fiftysons when the Achaeans came here; nineteen of them were from asingle womb, and the others were borne to me by the women of myhousehold. The greater part of them has fierce Mars laid low, andHector, him who was alone left, him who was the guardian of the cityand ourselves, him have you lately slain; therefore I am now come tothe ships of the Achaeans to ransom his body from you with a greatransom. Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven; think on your ownfather and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, for Ihave steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeled himself beforeme, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son."

　　Thus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as hebethought him of his father. He took the old man's hand and movedhim gently away. The two wept bitterly- Priam, as he lay atAchilles' feet, weeping for Hector, and Achilles now for his fatherand now for Patroclous, till the house was filled with theirlamentation. But when Achilles was now sated with grief and hadunburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he left his seat andraised the old man by the hand, in pity for his white hair andbeard; then he said, "Unhappy man, you have indeed been greatlydaring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of theAchaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so many ofyour brave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon this seat,and for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts, forweeping will not avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the lotthey spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Jove's palacethere stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the otherwith good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the giftshe sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he towhom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the fingerof scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world,and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither bygods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus; the gods endowed himwith all good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over theMyrmidons excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortalthough he was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on himtoo did heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal childrenborn to him in his house, save one son who is doomed to die alluntimely; nor may I take care of him now that he is growing old, for Imust stay here at Troy to be the bane of you and your children. Andyou too, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy. They saythat in wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed all that is inLesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia that is moreinland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from theday when the dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war andslaughter have been about your city continually. Bear up against it,and let there be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may foryour brave son, you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him fromthe dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall you."

　　And Priam answered, "O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector isstill lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransomwhich I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may lookupon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land insafety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look uponthe light of the sun."

　　Achilles looked at him sternly and said, "Vex me, sir, no longer;I am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother,daughter of the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid medeliver it to you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannothide it, that some god has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans,for else, no man however strong and in his prime would dare to come toour host; he could neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt ofmy gates thus easily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sinagainst the word of Jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though youare, within my tents."

　　The old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus spranglike a lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with himwent his two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him thanany others of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. Theseunyoked the horses and mules, and bade Priam's herald and attendant beseated within the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector's body fromthe waggon. but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, thatAchilles might wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home.Then he called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body andanoint it, but he first took it to a place where Priam should notsee it, lest if he did so, he should break out in the bitterness ofhis grief, and enrage Achilles, who might then kill him and sinagainst the word of Jove. When the servants had washed the body andanointed it, and had wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilleshimself lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on thewaggon. He cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dearcomrade, "Be not angry with me, Patroclus," he said, "if you hear evenin the house of Hades that I have given Hector to his father for aransom. It has been no unworthy one, and I will share it equitablywith you."

　　Achilles then went back into the tent and took his place on therichly inlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was atright angles to the one against which Priam was sitting. "Sir," hesaid, "your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according todesire; you shall look upon him when you him away at daybreak; for thepresent let us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to thinkabout eating, though her twelve children- six daughters and sixlusty sons- had been all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sonswith arrows from his silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew thedaughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she saidLeto had borne two children only, whereas she had herself bornemany- whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they lieweltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturnturned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods inheaven themselves buried them, and Niobe then took food, being wornout with weeping. They say that somewhere among the rocks on themountain pastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs live that haunt theriver Achelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and still nursesthe sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven. Therefore, noble sir,let us two now take food; you can weep for your dear son hereafteras you are bearing him back to Ilius- and many a tear will he costyou."

　　With this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep ofsilvery whiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all indue order. They cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spittedthem, and drew them off again when they were well roasted. Automedonbrought bread in fair baskets and served it round the table, whileAchilles dealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the goodthings that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eatand drink, Priam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strengthand beauty of Achilles for he was as a god to see, and Achillesmarvelled at Priam as he listened to him and looked upon his noblepresence. When they had gazed their fill Priam spoke first. "Andnow, O king," he said, "take me to my couch that we may lie down andenjoy the blessed boon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closedfrom the day your hands took the life of my son; I have grovelledwithout ceasing in the mire of my stable-yard, making moan andbrooding over my countless sorrows. Now, moreover, I have eatenbread and drunk wine; hitherto I have tasted nothing."

　　As he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set bedsin the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good redrugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaksfor Priam and Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torchand got the two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughinglyto Priam, "Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor ofthose who in due course keep coming to advise with me should see youhere in the darkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon.This might cause delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell meand tell me true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeralrites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war andrestrain the host."

　　And Priam answered, "Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble sonwith all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. Youknow how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetchwood from the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days,therefore, will we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day wewill bury him and there shall be a public feast in his honour; onthe eleventh we will build a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth,if there be need, we will fight."

　　And Achilles answered, "All, King Priam, shall be as you havesaid. I will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named."

　　As he spoke he laid his hand on the old man's right wrist, intoken that he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and hisattendant sleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, whileAchilles lay in an inner room of the house, with fair Briseis by hisside.

　　And now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through thelivelong night, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck,sleep could take no hold for he was thinking all the time how to getKing Priam away from the ships without his being seen by the strongforce of sentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam's head and said,"Sir, now that Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fearabout sleeping in the thick of your foes. You have paid a greatransom, and have received the body of your son; were you still aliveand a prisoner the sons whom you have left at home would have togive three times as much to free you; and so it would be ifAgamemnon and the other Achaeans were to know of your being here."

　　When he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.Mercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quicklythrough the host so that no man perceived them. When they came tothe ford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury wentback to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to breakover all the land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the citylamenting and making moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. Noone neither man nor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as goldenVenus standing on Pergamus, caught sight of her dear father in hischariot, and his servant that was the city's herald with him. Then shesaw him that was lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with aloud cry she went about the city saying, "Come hither Trojans, men andwomen, and look on Hector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming frombattle when he was alive, look now on him that was the glory of ourcity and all our people."

　　At this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great asorrow had possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as hewas bringing in the body. Hector's wife and his mother were thefirst to mourn him: they flew towards the waggon and laid theirhands upon his head, while the crowd stood weeping round them. Theywould have stayed before the gates, weeping and lamenting the livelongday to the going down of the sun, had not Priam spoken to them fromthe chariot and said, "Make way for the mules to pass you.Afterwards when I have taken the body home you shall have your fill ofweeping."

　　On this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon.When they had borne the body within the house they laid it upon abed and seated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the womenjoined in the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them allAndromache led their wailing as she clasped the head of mightyHector in her embrace. "Husband," she cried, "you have died young, andleave me in your house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starredparents is still a mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood.Ere he can do so our city will be razed and overthrown, for you whowatched over it are no more- you who were its saviour, the guardian ofour wives and children. Our women will be carried away captives to theships, and I among them; while you, my child, who will be with me willbe put to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be,some Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, toavenge some brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of themhave indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father's hand inbattle was no light one. Therefore do the people mourn him. You haveleft, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents, and my own griefis greatest of all, for you did not stretch forth your arms andembrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me any words that might havelived with me in my tears night and day for evermore."

　　Bitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.Hecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. "Hector," she cried,"dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive thegods loved you well, and even in death they have not been utterlyunmindful of you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, hewould sell him beyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos;and when he had slain you too with his sword, many a time did hedrag you round the sepulchre of his comrade- though this could notgive him life- yet here you lie all fresh as dew, and comely as onewhom Apollo has slain with his painless shafts."

　　Thus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, andthen Helen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation."Hector," said she, "dearest of all my brothers-in-law-for I am wifeto Alexandrus who brought me hither to Troy- would that I had died erehe did so- twenty years are come and gone since I left my home andcame from over the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult orunkindness from you. When another would chide with me, as it mightbe one of your brothers or sisters or of your brothers' wives, or mymother-in-law- for Priam was as kind to me as though he were my ownfather- you would rebuke and check them with words of gentleness andgoodwill. Therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappyself, for there is no one else in Troy who is kind to me, but allshrink and shudder as they go by me."

　　She wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round herjoined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, "Bringwood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of theArgives, for Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave mehis word that they should not attack us until the morning of thetwelfth day."

　　Forthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered togetherbefore the city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps wood,and on the morning of the tenth day with many tears they took traveHector forth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, andset the fire thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingereddawn appeared on the eleventh day, the people again assembled, roundthe pyre of mighty Hector. When they were got together, they firstquenched the fire with wine wherever it was burning, and then hisbrothers and comrades with many a bitter tear gathered his whitebones, wrapped them in soft robes of purple, and laid them in a goldenurn, which they placed in a grave and covered over with large stonesset close together. Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keepingguard on every side lest the Achaeans should attack them before theyhad finished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went backagain into the city, and being well assembled they held high feastin the house of Priam their king.

　　Thus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer ofhorses.
